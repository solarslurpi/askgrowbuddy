# my comments on 2021-11 Results

[[SP_2023-11-14_old]]  is the Saturated Paste Report in markdown format.

NOTE: Brandon and I determined not to review.  Rather, given the dramatic increase in Na, we decided I would flush the potting soil first and then retest.  We will review the retested results.  However. before we decided this i wanted to make sure I was as familiar with the results as possible and so I spent time documenting my thoughts in these notes.  They are the thoughts of a clueless learner with as much factual basis as I could look up (and hopefully interpret correctly).

## TEC
Ignore this number.

 **Value 18.7**: Total Exchange Capacity (TEC) doesn't accurately reflect the true cation exchange capacity, as the composition lacks the sand, silt, and clay found in natural soil.  The number will be extremely high.

## pH, Soluble Salts, Bicarbonate, Chloride



![[pH_and-soluble_salts.png|650]]

![[bicarbonate_chloride.png]]

| Date       | pH  | SP Bicarbonate (ppm) | SP Soluble Salts (ppm) | SP Chloride (ppm) |
|------------|-----|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 2022-06-08 | 7.10| 76                   | 637                    | 83                |
| 2023-03-03 | 7.20| 89                   | 1450                   | 135               |
| 2023-07-07 | 7   | 38                   | 805                    | 95                |
| 2023-11-11 | 6.30| 57                   | 1562                   | 192               |


- pH at 6.3 should be 6.8 or 6.9.
- Soluble Salts is 1562.  This is high.  **TBD: what is considered not high? i.e.: what is an acceptable range?**

**--> Need to raise the pH... Use Ag lime? (CaCO3) - I think the answer is yes because can't get too much Calcium?**

#### Raise the pH from 6.3 to 6.9

Ag lime...TBD: How calculate how much?


## Organic Matter
- Organic matter percentage is not an accurate metric for potting soils, ignore.

![[organic_matter_soil_results.png|350]]

| Date     | Organic Matter (%) |
|----------|-------|
| 2022-06  | 29.2  |
| 2023-03  | 20    |
| 2023-07  | 18.9  |
| 2023-11  | 20    |

**Value: 20**: It is typical of the potting soil substrates to show values that are greater than 20%.  A good  level typically seen in field soil has percentages between 2 to 4% .  7% is exceptionally high.   This inaccuracy is due to the nature of potting substrates, which contain various organic components that can affect the test results. 

## Phosphorus
### M3
**M3 target is 1500 lbs/acre Phosphate.**  e.g. from June 2022 results: _Phosphorus is very low at 661.  I would recommend 7 cups of bone meal and 3 cups of soft rock phosphate per yard_

![[phosphorus_soil_results.png|650]]



This grow period, I liberally applied Mammoth P.  Pretty much at least twice a week I put in water dosed with Mammoth P.  The amount of available Phosphorus went up to the range of Brandon's target between 2 and 4.  The amount of phosphate measured went down by about 50%.  All of these could be because of the sampling which will average out over time.  With that said, it seems that 1299 lbs/acre is still quite high.  

--> DISCUSSION

re: _Phosphorus is very low at 661.  I would recommend 7 cups of bone meal and 3 cups of soft rock phosphate per yard_

**Q: Why recommend this split of Phosphate sources?**

Let's say the goal is to raise the long term phosphorous to 1500 lbs/acre of Phosphate. 

**Q: Raising Phosphate Level to 1500 lbs/acre**
**Using Bone meal**

Assuming the bone meal contains 20% phosphate (P2O5), and we want to add 200 lbs of phosphate (P2O5) per acre  to raise the reading to 1500 lbs/acre:

Area in Acres = (Volume in Cubic Yards / Depth in Yards) * (1 / 4840)
My grow tent is 0.274 cubic yards.  Soil depth is 6" = 6/36 " per yard ~= 0.1667 yds. and there are 4840 square yards in an acre.

**Area in acres (0.274 cu yds/0.1667 yds )* (1/4840) = 0.00034 acres**

Bone meal required = P2O5 required / % Phosphate in Bone meal

Bone meal required = 200/0.2 = 1000

**Amt. Bone meal = 1000 * 0.00034 acre = 0.34 lbs of bone meal is needed to raise the amount of Phosphate to 1,500 lbs/acre.**

**Q: What about the Calcium in the Bone meal?**
Bone meal also has around 20% Ca.  I assume we will then use this in the Calcium calculation?






| Date     | M3 Phosphorous (lbs/acre) |
|----------|-------|
| 2022-06  | 661   |
| 2023-03  | 1217  |
| 2023-07  | 2160  |
| 2023-11  | 1299  |


Phosphorus in M3 soil tests, such as those conducted by Logan Labs, is reported as phosphate (P2O5).  The transformation of phosphate into a plant-absorbable form of phosphorus is done by phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, like those found in products like Mammoth .  These soil microbes play a pivotal role in this process by releasing enzymes that break down the P2O5 compound, freeing phosphorus for plant uptake.

Extra reserves of Phosphorous (P) are essential because the amount of phosphorous that plants can actually absorb is often much less than what is present in the soil as phosphate.

**M3 Value: 1299 lbs/acre:** 

 To convert to ppm, we assume  a soil based (e.g.: has alot of dirt, much heavier than living/potting soil we use) media:
```
# lbs -> ppm (assumes a furrow slice that weighs 2M lbs.)
1299 lbs/ acre * 0.5 = 649.5
# P2O5 -> P
649.5 * 0.44 = 283.44 ppm # Phosphate is only 44% Phosphorous
```

--> So we have a reserve of 283.44 ppm of Phosphorous locked up within Phosphate molecules. To unlock, we use something like Mammoth P to introduce microbes that specializing in breaking up the Phosphate modules.


### SP -  Available Phosphorous
**SP Target is between 2 and 4 ppm (note: Not uncommon to be below 2).**

| Date     | SP Phosphorous (ppm) |
|----------|----------------------|
| 2022-06  | 0.380                |
| 2023-03  | 0.560                |
| 2023-07  | 0.780                |
| 2023-11  | 2.40                 |


The saturated paste value for phosphorous tells us how much phosphorous is available in the soil solution for plant uptake.

**Value 2.4**
This is a significant increase from last reading of 0.780. This increase is most likely due to several doses of Mammoth P.  Our target is between 2 to 4 ppm. Brandon notes achieving a level of 2 ppm would put you ahead of 99% of the industry. However, he also notes that most phosphorus numbers he sees are very low, around 0.3 to 0.4 ppm, and yet many are still hitting their target metrics.

Mammoth P is a product that contains a consortium of natural beneficial soil bacteria designed to enhance phosphorus and micronutrient availability for plants. The bacteria in Mammoth P are highly effective at releasing phosphorus and making it more available to plants, thereby maximizing flower growth and increasing yield.

## Sulfur
![[M3_Sulfur_soil_result.png|650]]

The M3 Sulfur value jumped from 235 lbs/acre to 536 lbs/acre.  In an example M3 test we were reviewing, the sulfur reading was 146.3 ppm.  Brandon noted this value is elevated, but not a cause for concern, instead, he views it positively. Elevated sulfur is desirable because it provides the building blocks for volatile compounds like esters, alcohols, and terpenes—important for the characteristic aromas and flavors in crops, especially in cannabis.

High sulfur levels can enhance terpene expressions in plants. Maintaining adequate levels of sulfur is generally beneficial for plant health and does not pose a risk of nutrient imbalance.

--> HIGH AND LOW VALUES?

### SP

--> TBD: I do not have  a feel for these values. High, Low? Just right? Implications?

## Cations - Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Potassium (K)

![[Ca_Mg_K_NA_%.png|700]]

 **Calcium (Ca)**: Essential for cell wall structure and integrity, signal transduction, and overall plant health.
 
  **Magnesium (Mg)**: A central component of chlorophyll, necessary for photosynthesis, and plays a role in enzyme activation.
    
3. **Potassium (K)**: Important for osmoregulation, enzyme activation, and overall plant vigor.

#### Ideal %

| Nutrient  | Ideal Saturation (%) | Importance for Cannabis                                        |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calcium   | 60 - 75               | Essential for cell wall strength, nutrient uptake, and health  |
| Magnesium | 10 - 20               | Crucial for chlorophyll production and photosynthesis          |
| Potassium | 3 - 7                 | Vital for water regulation, nutrient transport, and enzymes    |
| Sodium    | Below 5               | Keep low to avoid nutrient imbalances and soil issues         |
| Hydrogen and Aluminum | Not directly targeted | Relevant to soil pH, which should be between 6.8 to 6.9 for cannabis |



Brandon stresses that while it is essential to have sufficient levels of these nutrients, it is equally important to ensure they are in balance with each other. An excess or deficiency of one can negatively impact the availability and effectiveness of the others. For example, excessive potassium can interfere with the uptake of calcium and magnesium, and vice versa.

#### Balancing Calcium with other Cations

The table emphasizes the data shown in the plot above:

| Date    | Calcium (Ca) | Magnesium (Mg) | Potassium (K) | Sodium (Na) | Ca:Mg:K Ratio   |
|---------|--------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 2022-06 | 62.3%        | 18.1%          | 11.9%         | 7.7%        | 5.24:1.52:1.00  |
| 2023-03 | 43.3%        | 18.9%          | 20.8%         | 17.0%       | 2.29:1.00:1.10  |
| 2023-07 | 74.7%        | 14.7%          | 6.17%         | 4.42%       | 12.11:2.38:1.00 |
| 2023-11 | 51.9%        | 24.6%          | 16.0%         | 7.58%       | 3.24:1.54:1.00  |


Tad (in Ep 61 discussion w/ Bill McKibben)noted: _when I see potassium drop below 5%, a grower reported, you know, smaller buds in what appears to be potassium deficiencies. And one other trend I noticed, which makes a lot of sense, because these are fairly weak ions, they move through the soil faster as potassium and nitrogen seem to be used up by the plant or by people's watering habits_

**IDEAL RATIO: 5-6 Ca : 1 Mg : 2 K**

William Albrecht's approach to balancing soil nutrients included targeting a potassium level that is twice the magnesium level, with magnesium being one fifth to one-sixth (e.g.: 68:12) of the calcium level.




## Calcium

![[M3_Ca.png|400]]

![[SP_Ca (meq_ppm).png|600]]
Calcium is crucial not only for root development but also for developing cell walls. Calcium is important  in preventing diseases like powdery mildews, especially in high humidity environments.

- 253 ppm Ca is in the soil but not plant available.
	- ?? For most crops, including cannabis, a calcium level of about 100 to 200 ppm in a soil solution is generally considered sufficient.   A level of 253 ppm suggests that there is an ample amount of calcium available in the soil solution for cannabis plants. This is particularly important during the vegetative growth stage when calcium demand is high for developing cell walls and maintaining strong structural growth. ??
- 12.7 meq/L Ca is plant available.
	- ?? In most crops, a calcium level of around 5 to 15 meq/L is considered adequate. ??


--> pH - Ag lime?  If so, how to know how much?
--> DISCUSS: M3 seems high.  so isn't it just about plant available and releasing what is in the soil?
--> High/low baseline values for M3 and SP...


## Magnesium

![[M3 Magnesium lbs_acre.png|400]]


Magnesium is part of chlorophyll production and photosynthesis. It's also essential for enzyme activation and overall plant vigor.

If a deficiency of magnesium is suspected, an easy way to confirm it is through foliar feeding with Epsom salts (one tablespoon per gallon of water). If the next set of leaves turns properly green, it confirms a magnesium deficiency. In such cases, it is recommended to continue foliar feeding with Epsom salts, ideally once every few weeks. Note: The chemical formula for Epsom salt is MgSO<sub>4</sub> . 7H<sub>2</sub>O (Magnesium Sulfate heptahydrate (7 water molecules))



![[SP_Mg.png|650]]

--> Magnesium is at its highest since we've been testing.  Again, i don't have a good idea for how much/ and available cations.  Review...

## Potassium
(from [UMN Extension](https://extension.umn.edu/phosphorus-and-potassium/potassium-crop-production))
potassium plays a role in stand persistence through the winter. Other roles of K include:
- Increases root growth and improves drought resistance.
- Maintains turgor; reduces water loss and wilting.
- Aids in photosynthesis and food formation.
- Reduces respiration, preventing energy losses.
- Enhances translocation of sugars and starch.
- Produces grain rich in starch.
- Increases plants’ protein content.
- Builds cellulose.
- Helps retard crop diseases.


![[M3_Potassium_lbs_acre.png|400]]
![[SP Potassium.png|650]]

On the Logan Labs results, it notes K should be in the range of 2-5% relative to the other important cations.  The current reading has K at 16%
 
--> TBD: I have no feel for K values and the implications.  I think the K is too high but ...

## Sodium

Brandon (in a previous discussion): If your sodium reaches close to 200 ppm on the Mehlich III or if you have excessive nitrates or cations you can flush your soil. First, you will want a low sodium water source but then you would flush until you get 10% runoff by volume. For example a 4'x4' bed would hold about 100 gallons. For a flush you would want 10 gallons of water to come out of the bed. It is important that the bed is wet to field capacity (the point right before runoff) before you start to count the runoff. With dry soil there will be a good bit of water that runs off but really doesn't grab any ions on its way. You can use a saponin to increase the effectiveness of your flush. A saponin or a surfactant will reduce surface tension allowing water to penetrate the substrate more thoroughly. Alternatively you can use a pH/EC meter. You would want to see the EC or PPM reading drop by half on your pour through.


![[M3_Sodium_lbs_acre.png|450]]

The sodium went up significantly from 90 to 172.  Looking at the two previous results, the same thing happened - this time from 104 to 189.

The immediate thing I think of is the Na coming in from the irrigation water.  Yet, the last water test I got: [[Water-20230321.pdf]] shows 0.5 ppm sodium, which is 1 lb/acre (assume furrow slice weighs 2M lbs...).  So how did it get from 90 to 172 if it was not the water?
-> retest water?  The challenge though is wouldn't i have to install an RO filter to remove NA (ionic exchange filtering?)
![[SP Na meq and ppm.png|650]]

The available Na is much less than two times ago....hmm...

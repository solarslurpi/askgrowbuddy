# Mehlic-3 and Saturated Paste - 2023-03 soil reports



- given my #growtentsize (see [[Grow Tent]]), it is 0.274 cubic yards.
## mehlich-3
- pH has risen from 7.1 to 7.2.  The sweet spot is between 6.8 - 6.9.  Add 1/2 cup of elemental sulfur / yard
	- .5 * 0.275 = 0.1375 cps
- Phosphorous at 1217 lbs/acre needs  3 cps soft rock / yard.  Brandon recommended Calphos(sp?)
	- 3 * 0.274 = 0.822 cps.
- Calcium is 4282 lbs/acre. add 2 cups/yard of bone meal.  I get bone meal at Home Depot.  Unclear if I should be getting from a more responsible source?
	- 2 * 0.274 = 0.548 cps.
- Ammonium is 0.2 ppm and Nitrate is 65.1 ppm. Could do a several things to handle nitrogen (feathermeal, bloodmeal, alpha alpha).  I have some alpha alpha so I'm going to use that.
	- 2.4 cps * 0.274 = 0.66 cps
## Saturated Paste
- The amount of soluble salts is high at 1450ppm.  Too high is 1500.  So right on the border! We'll not flush this time because we've already done the lab tests.  But definitely after next grow.  I sent out for a water test to Logan Labs. 
- Mg is > 10% (11.75) so it is fine. Not adding any additional.

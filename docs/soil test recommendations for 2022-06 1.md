# 2022-06 soil report Brandon's recommendations

Based on the numbers in your soil reports:
- [[Mehlich-3 soil test 2022-06-30]]
- [[Saturated Paste soil test 2022-06-30]]]

I have the following notes:

## **Mehlich-3:**

-   pH is 7.1.  pH is starting to climb out of the sweet spot (6.8-6.9) but I would not take any action unless it continues to climb. You can always pH down your irrigation source to 6.8 if you want to make a small adjustment. If it continues to climb we can add elemental sulfur.
-   Phosphorus is very low at 661. I would recommend 7 cups of bone meal and 3 cups of soft rock phosphate per yard (201.9 gallons of soil-if you need help with your soil volume let me know). I would also keep an eye on the Paste test P metric after you get your amendments in. Once you have sufficient P on the Mehlic-3 monitor the Saturated Past test  for sufficiency 2-4 ppm. If it is low after adding the bone and soft rock you might consider running Mammoth P or some other phosphorus solubilizing bacteria. 
-   Cations look great but we will base decisions on the Paste Test.
	- The Cations on the mehlic-3 test:
		- Calcium (60-70%) : 77.06
		- Magnesium (10-20%): 11.39
		- Potassium (2-5%): 5.41
		- Sodium (.5 to 3%): 1.83
-   Sodium at 104 lbs/acre is starting to get high. Keep an eye on it going forward. 
-   Alluminum ppm is 108.  We discussed the high aluminum number. Sometimes this is a testing anomaly. I would hold off on adding any of your compost for now and we will keep an eye on this next round. 
-   Ammonium at 0.9 ppm is perfect
-   Nitrate at 25.1 ppm is very low, around 50 pounds per acre. If you are planning a two week veg I would want that number closer to 150 pounds per acre. You could add some feather meal or blood meal. If you add the bone as fishbone meal for your phosphorus this will bring in some N as well. If you went with the standard bovine bone meal for P I would add 2 cups feather meal per yard OR 10 cups alfalfa. If you need a metric for N based on a different input let me know. 

## **Saturated Paste test:**

-   Sulfur at 54.88 ppm is good for now- provides terpenes
- P at 0.38 is low.
-   Cations look pretty great but I would add 2 cups of gypsum per yard. This will improve your balance and help calcium compete with Mg.
		The Cations on the Saturated Past test:
		- Calcium (%) : 62.28
		- Magnesium (%): 18.08
		- Potassium (%): 11.85
		- Sodium (3%): 7.79
-   Do not add Mg for now. If you see lower leaf interveinal yellowing let me know. That is a clear Mg deficiency.
-   Add 1 cup per yard of potassium sulfate to bring your cations into a better balance.

## mehlic-3

- TEC (Total Exchange Cation) is not an accurate metric for potting substrates, ignore.
- pH at 7.0 is excellent. I prefer the target range of 6.8 to 6.9 for optimal nutrient release rates and reduced heavy metal uptake.  Continue to pH your irrigation events to 6.8-7.0 with a heavy metals safe pH down product. I prefer citric acid. You're too close to perfect to make any adjustments here. Great job! You will have an excellent round at 7.0.
- Organic matter percentage is not an accurate metric for potting soils, ignore. 
- 2160 lbs/acra of P2O5 is a touch above my target of 1500, but excellent. Phosphorus is hard to get into solution so a really big reserve is required to provide available P to your plants. It is really hard to have too much P. No action, this is great! 
- Cations look a touch off but we will look at the Paste Report for actionable metrics. I place much more weight on the available cations shown on your Paste Report. 
-	- The Cations on the mehlic-3 test:
		- Calcium (60-70%) : 81.28
		- Magnesium (10-20%): 9.48
		- Potassium (2-5%): 3.57
		- Sodium (.5 to 3%): 1.26
- Sodium is good but creeping up at 90 lbs/acre. I ask folks to flush anytime they hit 200 so you should be able to get several more rounds without a flush. Luckily sodium is easy to flush. If sodium gets too high it causes osmotic stress and can outcompete productive cations, especially potassium. Once you approach 200 ppm we will want to set up a plan to flush. Flush 10% by volume. Be sure to get the soil to field capacity and use a surfactant to improve the efficacy of the flush. You will want to capture 10% by volume meaning if you have a 4'x4' with 100 gallons you will need to capture 10 gallons. Be sure to add some trichoderma (Rootshield) or some Lactobacillus at the end of your flush to prevent fungal pathogens from taking a foothold. If you choose to run this without a flush be on the lookout for cation deficiencies and symptoms of osmotic stress. No action at this time.
- Exchangeable hydrogen is just another way to look at PH, you can ignore.
- Your trace elements look a bit off (Cu 1.17 ppm and Zn 3.33 ppm) but be careful chasing a "perfect" trace element metric. There is almost always plenty of trace available through contamination from water or compost. Trace elements, while essential, are not composed into the plant and can be used over and over again so very little is needed. The margin for error between a perfect metric and dead plants and ruined soil is hard to achieve in a field with an enormous buffer so it is dangerous territory in raised beds or pots. Proceed with caution. It is my opinion that these should be left alone unless a specific deficiency tied to one of the trace elements shows visually. 
- Ammonium at 0.2 ppm is great. I normally look for a metric of 0.9 or lower. This soil is temperature stable. You should not get any additional nitrate release from this either. No action.
-  anytime Nitrate drops below 30 ppm all growth stops but I get equally concerned anytime a test goes over 200 for an indoor run.  Do not over apply. Excess nitrate at harvest diminishes terpenes, reduces yield and delays senescence.  It is always a best practice to add as many nitrate inputs as possible for optimal release rates. You will have a small gap to fill.

## Saturated Paste
- Soluble salts at 805 ppm are a pinch low, reflective of low nitrates and cations.. No action, our prescription will remedy this. Optimally, we want you to land between 1000-1200.
- Chlorides at 95 ppm are fine, no action.
- Bicarbonates at 38 ppm are fine, no action.
- Sulfur is elevated but excellent at 124.2 ppm. We want adequate sulfur for building our volatiles; esters, alcohols and terpenes. No action.
- Available P is surprisingly low at 0.78 ppm. Sufficiency is 2-4 ppm so I would expect you to be closer to my targets with such great reserves. Running a P solubilizing bacteria will keep you at the upper end of sufficiency. Hopefully using a P solubilizing bacteria will bring you up.

- Calcium is at 187.9 is low. I normally see that at 200. Luckily gypsum won't drag your pH and it is really hard to have too much Ca. Add 0.5 cups of gypsum.  For a small volume input like this it is often best to suspend in an aqueous solution and spray it onto the bed for even coverage. Then scratch it in.


**.5 * .274 = .137 of a cup of gypsum**

- Mg at 22.22 ppm is also very low but based on your Mehlic-3 percentages we will hold off on any epsom salt additions at this time. Mg is the bully cation and will outcompete both Ca and K. 

- Potassium is also low at only 29.9 ppm. Add 1.24 cups of potassium sulfate per yard. For a small volume input like this it is often best to suspend in an aqueous solution and spray it onto the bed for even coverage. Then scratch it in.
--> 1.24 cups of potassium sulfate / yard.  (see [[March 2023/Brandon's recommendations|Brandon's recommendations]]) 

**1.24 * .274 = .34 of a cup of potassium sulfate**

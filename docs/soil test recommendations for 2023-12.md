# Mehlic-3 and Saturated Paste Test results _2023_12

This discussion is based on the [[Margaret Johnson-Soil-20231218-168413.pdf]] M3 Report and [[Margaret Johnson-Saturated Paste-20231218-168413.pdf]] Saturated Paste Report.

The M3 (mehlic-3) report is "your battery".  Your long term reserves. The Saturated Paste report shows us what the plant sees (what is available and not locked up).

## Amendment Recommendations
The below detailed conversation led to the following recommendations (Note: measurements are given in cups/yard)

- The pH in these reports is 5.5 - way too low. Cannabis should be at 6.8 to 7.0.  When I flushed the potting soil, I washed away the cations which get replaced with Hydrogen.  Hence, the pH goes down. To raise the pH to 6.8 to 7.0: Add either 2 cups per yard of wollastonite or **1 cup per yard of aglime**.  Brandon would go with the aglime just because you're low and you want to get this up fast. 5.5 is really low.

## M3 Feedback
[[Margaret Johnson-Soil-20231218-168413.pdf]]
The first thing Brandon does is to grab the Mehlich 3 report. 
- Skip over Sample Location, Sample ID, Sample Depth in inches, Total Exchange Capacity
- Important is the pH, which in this report is 5.5 (we want to get it back to 6.8-7.0)...pH of the soil at 5.5. I had flushed the (potting) soil prior to sending samples to Logan Labs for testing.  The reason post flush that you see your pH change is  anytime any of your cations get displaced, hydrogen takes that place. And so your pH drops. The flushing removed sodium and other cations, replacing with hydrogen - so the pH goes down.
- The Organic Matter Percent (in this case >20) just tells me this is not in-situ soil, rather a potting soil mix.
- Sulfur AT 373 ppm: Don't have a target, so I skip it.  Actionable data for Sulfur is in the Saturated Paste test.
- For the most part, there isn't a reason to go back to historical data, just use the here and now results - unless a deficiency (in the example Magnesium) is consistent across runs.
- Phosphate is at 1582.  This is right at my target of 1,500.
- Calcium is 5832 lbs/acre.  Target value for Calcium lbs/acre is 4,000.
- Magnesium is 311 lbs/acre. Target value for Magnesium is 350 lbs/acre.
- Potassium is 242 lbs/acre. Target value for Potassium is 600 lbs/acre.  This seems high, but cannabis uses more. Besides, we are not eating Cannabis, but smoking it.
- Sodium is at 47 lbs/acre.  That is great.  Anything under 200, if you're at 200 and everything else looks pretty good, I'll tell people to run it. Because I want to save you money. I don't want you to flush. If you're at 200, go ahead and do the run. Flush at the end and retest.
- The base saturation numbers are important.  As Brandan has said, the Saturated Paste report has the actionable data, but the M3 is where Brandon looks for 60% to 70% calcium, 12% to 15% magnesium. 
- 	- The Cations on the mehlic-3 test:
		- Calcium (60-70%) : 56.92
		- Magnesium (10-20%): 5.06
		- Potassium (2-5%): 2.42
		- Sodium (.5 to 3%): .4
- Brandon will typically recommend low levels of magnesium amendment because magnesium deficits are easy to detect.   And it's so easy to fix. Just two tablespoons of Epsom salt as a drench. Boom, the magnesium deficit is gone.  Magnesium is the bully cation. It will out-compete calcium and potassium.  In theory, calcium should dislodge everything. In practice, magnesium is the one that causes all the problems. So one thing you could do is you could do is a flush with gypsum. Because it will displace magnesium and potassium and sodium. So if you've got really high sodium, you might want to add a little bit of gypsum. 
- The exchangeable hydrogen is just a reverse of the log that gets you to your pH. So I just tell people to ignore that one.
- Brandon doesn't look too hard at trace elements, boron, iron, manganese, and aluminum. I look at iron (in this report the iron on the saturated paste was 171 ppm) and aluminum (93 ppm), not even looking to see really what the number is, but just to see if one of them is really high and one of them is not really high, then I'm going to have a concern about either iron or aluminum. Let's say your iron was 300 and your aluminum's at 30. Then that gives me confidence that your iron's way too high and we need to address that. If I see them both high, both iron and aluminum high, most of our substrate is made up of iron and aluminum.   Brandon was seeing weird anomalies so he talked with Susan at Logan. Susan noted it's an iron aluminum lattice that forms most of our substrate. And they use filter papers when they're setting up the testing. If a little piece of that substrate gets sucked around the filter paper, you'll see aluminum and iron both really high.  If you see that, don't worry about it.  if iron or aluminum - one is high and one is lower, then we want to investigate. If they're 171 and 93, I wouldn't flinch about either. on the mehlic-3, the only ones that I really look at are copper (on this test it was < 0.02) and zinc (< 0.02). I'm looking for copper somewhere around 5. I'm looking for zinc around 10.
- If your pH at 5.5 and you had excessive zinc or copper, you're in trouble. It's going to flood the plant. At 5.5, you're going to flood your plant with copper. And so Brandon always goes back to that Bruce Bugbee Utah State testing where they were doing the hydro versus the organics with the copper to see if they can get systemic benefit against fungal pathogen, they were running like 900, 9,000, Brandon can't remember the number, but some really crazy high copper concentration. All the hydro plants were crispy, necrotic, and dead. All the organic plants, the organic matter was holding on to it. And we run at a much higher pH.
- The pH in these reports is 5.5 - way too low. Cannabis should be at 6.8 to 7.0.  When I flushed the potting soil, I washed away the cations which get replaced with Hydrogen.  Hence, the pH goes down. To raise the pH to 6.8 to 7.0: Add either 2 cups per yard of wollastonite or 1 cup per yard of aglime.  Brandon would go with the aglime just because you're low and you want to get this up fast. 5.5 is really low. Now, with that said, your pH is going to naturally come up with some of our amendments. So you could probably get away with the wollastonite. But if it was me, I'd probably go with the 1 cup of agline just to get my pH up fast. 
- And then the last section of the Mehlic 3 - "Other", have numbers for Ammonium and nitrate.  Ammonium and nitrate are your two forms of nitrogen in your soil. Some plants prefer one or the other. Cannabis does great with nitrates. When Brandon looks at the Ammonium number, if it is 0.9 or lower, he is great with it.  Experientially, we know that under 1, we're not having ammonium cycling into nitrate. This means the temperature in the soil is going to be stable. The roots are not going to get burnt.  Brandon just saw somebody that had all their ammonium numbers  above 11, like 11, 16.  They are going to get a ton of nitrate from that!  We see high ammonium anytime somebody adds compost, worm cast that's not finished, or somebody floods their beds. And that's just part of the chemistry of how the cycling happens.  If you go anaerobic in a bed, the nitrates will show up as ammonium. And that's why you get that stinky ammonia smell. It's actually your nitrate leaving your pocket, your dollars are leaving your bed. 
- Back to Phosphate.  The Phosphate number of 1582 lbs/acre  is sufficiency right on the dot. The target Phosphate number is  1500. Where nitrate, you have nothing. It all got washed out when you did the flush. And so it shows you how mobile sodium and nitrates are. They both went down a lot. 
- The nitrate number is 1 ppm.  Logan Labs makes it easy for us to figure out how many lbs/acre this is.  Given what we assume about a  [[soil science notes#Furrow Slice]] , where the soil ways 2M lbs, 1 ppm of Nitrate = 2 lbs/acre.  Very little Nitrate.  The Nitrate was flushed out of the soil.  Nitrates work with sulfur to provide all the amino acids and  proteins. 
- When Brandon sees nitrate really low and Phosphate at 1582, He is really tempted to bump that phosphorus reserve up. While not as environmentally responsible. However, Brandon is fine with it because the phosphorus is not gonna go anywhere. One, we don't have runoff. Phosphorus doesn't off gas like nitrate does. Phosphorus with no runoff and organic forms that are slow to cycle, it's not going anywhere.  If we added seven cups of fish bone meal and five cups of calphos, the phosphate's going to be well over 2300 for the next round. But then you are not going to have to add any phosphate for like three rounds maybe.  **Seven cups of fish bone will bring in 96 pounds of nitrate.????**
- ( I am confused by the 96 pounds of Nitrate)..but...Brandon starts out figuring how much Nitrate needed to be added by starting at 200 as the target,  He then subtracts the amount of Nitrate in the fish bone meal (which he calculated to be 96 lbs, and I don't understand how that happens) 200lbs/acre Nitrate target - 96 lbs/acre -2 lbs/acre left in the soil = 102 lbs/acre deficit that can be filled with different nitrate inputs.
- Brandon's three favorite Nitrogen additives include alfalfa, soybean, and feather meal.  Any input that you get is going to have its fines (In soil science, "fines" refer to the fine particles in soil, like silt and clay) . So there's a fast little flush of nitrate from feather meal because of the fines, but then it slowly breaks down, trickles out through the rest of the round. And so something like blood meal, it's going to be super fast, very available. You're going to burn through all of it in the first month. Brandon likes to do multiple inputs for different release rates when a larger amount of Nitrogen is needed. 

## Saturated Paste Report
[[Margaret Johnson-Saturated Paste-20231218-168413.pdf]]
- The first number Tad looks at is Soluble Salts (425 ppm).  Brandon's target for soluble salts is around 1,000 to 1,200. Something that Brandon has noticed from looking at thousands of reports is that this number really is just reflective of your calcium, magnesium, potassium, and chlorides. It should be more, it should give us a better picture of nitrate as well.  But Brandon used to think nitrates were  also reflected in the Soluble Salts number.  This doesn't seem to be the case, because he'll see really low numbers with really high nitrates and ammonium. And so when Brandon looks at the Soluble Salts number,  he uses it mainly as a guesstimate as to how he is going to balance the cations. The number on the Saturated Paste test (425 lbs/acre ) tells us without even looking at your calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium that they're gonna be low. And sure enough, they are.  Once the Soluble Salt number gets above 1,200,  the plant could grow well, but we're going past sufficiency. When the Soluble Salt level exceeds the sufficiency number of around 1,200, plants experience increased osmotic stress
- Chloride at 52 ppm is great!  200-300 is in the very high range.  The sodium and chloride metrics are very low.  Four or five rounds of growing should be possible without thinking about flushing.
- Everybody's trace elements are low. I don't worry about it because if the chlorides aren't high, it doesn't block and you don't have issues. As long as you're not over watering or having chlorides, trace elements are rarely gonna be the limiting factor.  Brandon does not like to increase the trace elements because low amounts do not block the health of the plant and too much trace elements (e.g.: Boron) could mean throwing out the soil.
- Bicarbonates at 34 ppm.  That's fantastic.  Brandon  noted maybe one in a thousand tests, he'll see a bicarbonate issue. If the Bicarbonates number is anything under 120, I wouldn't even worry about. If the number is too high, it's going to be reflecting in the pH and other readings will be off because of the hard water.
- Sulfur at 37.82 ppm  is low.  I like to target a reading of 68.  Adding elemental Sulfur to adjust the Sulfur level is a mistake in this situation since the pH is 5.5. Elemental Sulfur is great at lowering the pH.  Which is exactly what we do not need.  Since the Soluble Salts number is low, the Cations (CA, MG, K) when these are fixed will bring in the Sulfates that will raise the amount of Sulfur.
- The Phosphorus number is at 0.77 ppm.  Although higher than many, 0.77  is below the target of 2.4 (which 97% of the growers are below this target). That tells me that at the minimum sufficiency of 1500 lbs/acre of Phosphate, you're getting 0.77 available. So there's two things we could do. We can bump up the  reserve, which we're gonna do.  And/or we could add microbial mass, like the Mammoth P product  once a week. Brandon has some growers that have phosphorus (as Phosphate) reserves above 3000. They're running microbial mass or something like that once a month. They are getting readings far greater than 2.4 ppm - around 6 ppm because their reserve is so high.
- The cations: let's do calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. 

### Cation Ration

The Cations on the Saturated Past test:
		- Calcium (%) : 78.85
		- Magnesium (%): 15.82
		- Potassium (%): 8.65
		- Sodium (3%): 2.98
78%. It's just too high calcium. Magnesium's fine. Potassium's really low. Sodium's fine.  

- Magnesium: Let's take a quick look at the Magnesium percentage on the M3:
### Magnesium % in M3
Brandon noted this is a little tip. If your Magnesium is above 10% on your M3 report, ignore it on your paste report.   Your Magnesium percentage on the Mehlich 3 is at 5.06, so this isn't the case with this reading. That goes back to magnesium in practice and actual field practice. Magnesium runs the cations. It will out-compete potassium. Potassium is much more important in Cannabis than it is for nutrient-dense food. Too much Magnesium will prevent your potassium from getting into the plant. So my targets this is just between you and me, calcium 200, magnesium 38, and potassium 125.  And that's why I ask people to do that second application of potassium sulfate.  From our discussions, we know that potassium and calcium, that's what puts on weight. That's what puts on yield. 

#### Soluble Cations on the Saturated Paste Test
###### Ideal
- Calcium: 200 ppm
- Magnesium: 38 ppm
- Potassium: 125 ppm

Of the cations, the first number Brandon looks at is Magnesium.  The number on the test is 12.63 ppm.  The target is 38 ppm.  Let's say your magnesium comes in high - say 52. If the Magnesium reading is really high - say 70 or over, we might want to flush. Once the Magnesium is close to or above double the target, we should consider flushing. But the normal way to correct high Magnesium, let's say your magnesium's 52 and your calcium's 104, you simply divide 52 by the target, 38, and that gives me a factor of 1.37. So I'm gonna multiply that by my calcium target, 200. And that tells me my adjusted calcium target is 273. So it went up from 200 to 273 to account for that magnesium excess.

### Magnesium ppm 
The Magnesium number in the Saturated Paste report is 12.63 ppm, so it's low. And the Magnesium % is less than 10% on the Mehlic 3.  We know from this Magnesium is not a problem. 
### Calcium ppm
So Brandon jumps back up to calcium

200 (Calcium target) minus 104.9 ~= 95 deficit.  We add add three cups of gypsum (calcium sulfate) which brings in that sulfur we're missing. 
### Back to Magnesium
The target for Magnesium is 38 ppm.  We have 12.63 in the soil.  This makes for a deficit of 38 - 12.63 ~= 25 ppm. There's two ways you could approach this. You could add 1.1 cups of magnesium sulfate, or you could do nothing and wait and see if you get a magnesium deficiency.  A lot of times Tad, when he's doing recommendations, he'll skip over magnesium as long as it's in deficit and just tell them not to do anything unless they see a problem. And that's a safe way to handle it. What Brandon typically does is bump down the amount to amend to 1/2 of the deficit. In this case 0.75 cups of magnesium sulfate.  Most growers go in with a heavy hand. Even if they fall short, it's so easy to fix that with the magnesium drench. The plants will respond in 24 to 48 hours.  I want to make sure that you've got enough to get going.  Magnesium is the central element in the chlorophyll molecule. So it is very important to be in the soil.

Getting a cup or less of magnesium sulfate spread out evenly over a bed is going to be really hard. You're going to have dead spots and hot spots. And so a lot of times with epsom and potassium, if it's a cup or less, I'll make it up in solution. 

## Potassium Sulfate
 Potassium sulfate is at 8.65 ppm. The maximum amount Brandon recommends of  potassium sulfate, just from doing it over repetition, is 1.3 cups.  The target level for potassium is 125 ppm. Anytime it is 100 or under, Brandon recommends the maximum level of 1.3 potassium sulfate.  your gap's at least 100 or more, 1.3 cups, and then a half cup after stretch. 

## Trace Elements

- Boron:  you're at 0.03. Brandon likes to see that it is no higher than 0.2. So you're low on boron. 
- Iron: you're at 0.26. Brandon likes to see Iron 0.75. 
- Manganese, you're low, below 0.2.  Brandon likes to be at 0.2 to 0.4. 
- Copper (< 0.02 ppm) and zinc (<0.02 ppm), Brandon looks at those numbers on the mehlic-3, but 0.02, 0.02 is fine. 
- Aluminum (0.24): As long as it's under 1, Brandon's not too worried about it. 

For most growers, there are many other nutrient imbalances that need to be adjusted before addressing Trace Minerals.  And when they are addressed, it needs to be done carefully.  Too much trace elements can be toxic.

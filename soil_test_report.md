# pH

6.9

Based on the provided context, a pH value of 6.9 falls within the optimal range for growing Cannabis, which is [6.8, 6.9]. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary.

However, I would like to discuss the importance of measuring and maintaining this optimal pH range.

The text mentions that soils with a pH below 7 (acidic soils) contain hydrogen ions (H+), which can react with limestone (CaCO3) to form calcium ions (Ca2+). This process is beneficial for plant growth, as calcium is crucial for root development and cell wall construction. Additionally, a pH value of 6.9 may help in suppressing powdery mildew, especially in high humidity environments.

To maintain this optimal pH range, growers can consider using Wollastonite, which has a liming capability and provides a buffering effect against rapid pH changes. This can help stabilize the soil pH and ensure that it remains within the optimal range for Cannabis growth.

In terms of measuring pH values, I do not have enough information to provide guidance on how to measure or adjust the value without knowing the specific tools or methods used by the grower. However, I would recommend consulting with a qualified expert in soil science or using reputable resources to determine the best approach for measuring and adjusting pH levels.

Regarding the mention of M3 values (25.3 meq/L Ca) being "high," it's likely that this value is plant-available calcium, which is considered adequate for Cannabis growth at around 5-15 meq/L. Therefore, the concern may be more about the overall calcium content in the soil solution rather than the specific M3 value.

To summarize, a pH value of 6.9 falls within the optimal range for growing Cannabis, and no adjustments are necessary. However, maintaining an optimal pH range is crucial for plant growth, and using Wollastonite can help achieve this goal.

# soluble_salts_ppm

1464.0

Based on the provided context, the soluble salts ppm (SPP) value of 1464.0 is above the optimal range for growing Cannabis, which is [1000, 1200].

According to the provided information, calcium levels in soil solution are generally considered sufficient when they reach around 5-15 meq/L for most crops, including cannabis. Since 12.7 meq/L Ca is mentioned as plant available and the optimal range is between 253 ppm (not meq/L) and 1000 ppm, it seems that the SPP value of 1464.0 is still relatively high compared to the upper limit of the optimal range.

To adjust the value, you could try using Wollastonite to raise pH and reduce soluble salts. However, without more specific information on the exact relationship between SPP values and calcium bicarbonate decomposition rate, it's difficult to provide a precise adjustment strategy.

Here are some general suggestions based on the context:

1. Monitor pH levels: Regularly check soil pH levels to ensure they don't become too high.
2. Limit lime application: Use Wollastonite in moderation, as excessive use can lead to rapid pH changes.
3. Balance calcium bicarbonate decomposition rate: This might involve adjusting other factors like temperature or microbial activity.

Keep in mind that these suggestions are based on limited information and may not be optimal for your specific situation. It's recommended to consult with a more experienced grower or conduct further research before making significant adjustments to your nutrient regime.

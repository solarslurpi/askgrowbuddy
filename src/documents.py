    "The ideal pH range for cannabis cultivation is between 6.8 and 6.9, often referred to as the 'sweet spot'.",

    "Phosphorus levels in soil are crucial for cannabis growth, with a target of 1,500 lbs/acre on the Mehlich-3 test.",

    "The Saturated Paste test provides actionable data on nutrient availability, while the Mehlich-3 test shows long-term nutrient reserves.",

    "Cation ratios in soil are important, with ideal ranges being 60-70% calcium, 12-15% magnesium, 2-5% potassium, and 0.5-3% sodium.",

    "Sodium levels above 200 lbs/acre in soil may require flushing to prevent nutrient imbalances and osmotic stress.",

    "Ammonium levels below 0.9 ppm in soil indicate stable soil temperature and reduced risk of root burn.",

    "Nitrate levels for cannabis should ideally be between 150-200 lbs/acre, depending on the vegetative growth period.",

    "Soluble salts in the range of 1,000-1,200 ppm on the Saturated Paste test are considered optimal for cannabis growth.",

    "Magnesium is considered a 'bully cation' that can outcompete calcium and potassium if present in excess.",

    "Phosphorus availability in soil should be between 2-4 ppm on the Saturated Paste test for optimal uptake by cannabis plants.",

    "Sulfur levels around 68 ppm in soil contribute to the development of terpenes and other volatile compounds in cannabis.",

    "Calcium levels in soil should target around 4,000 lbs/acre on the Mehlich-3 test for optimal cannabis growth.",

    "Potassium is particularly important for cannabis, with a target of 600 lbs/acre on the Mehlich-3 test.",

    "Chloride levels between 200-300 ppm in soil are considered very high and may require attention.",

    "Bicarbonate levels under 120 ppm in soil are generally not a concern for cannabis cultivation.",

    "Trace elements like boron, iron, manganese, copper, and zinc are important but should be managed carefully to avoid toxicity.",

    "Flushing the soil can help reduce sodium and other excess nutrients, but it can also lower pH by replacing cations with hydrogen.",

    "Organic matter percentage in potting soils is typically high (>20%) and not an accurate metric for nutrient availability.",

    "Phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, like those in Mammoth P, can help increase phosphorus availability in soil.",

    "Balancing calcium, magnesium, and potassium is crucial for optimal nutrient uptake in cannabis plants."

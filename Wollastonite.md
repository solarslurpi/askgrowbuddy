Growers  turn to Wollastonite for:
- Its **liming** capability.  Wollastonite's dissolution rate is slower than agricultural lime, offering a buffering effect against rapid pH changes. This makes Wollastonite beneficial in areas with fluctuating acidity levels.
- Adding **Silicon**.
- Adding **Calcium**.
Wollastonite's pH buffering effect and Silicon content contribute to pest control and powdery mildew suppression, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.

# What is Wollastonite?

## Formation
Wollastonite is formed when Limestone is subjected to heat and pressure during metamorphism if surrounding silicate minerals are present.
### Basic Reaction:
Given high pressure and high temperature:
- CaCO3 (Limestone) + SiO2 (silica) → CaSiO3 (Wollastonite) + CO2 (carbon Dioxide)
## Sources
China is the largest producer of Wollastonite. Other areas where Wollastonite is mined include the United States (although it was originally mined in California, the only active mining in the U.S. is now in New York State), India, Mexico, Canada, and Finland.

## Industrial Applications of Wollastonite

|Industry|Application|
|---|---|
|Ceramics|Smoother and more durable ceramics, reinforcement agent|
|Plastics and Rubber|Cost-effective strengthening agent|
|Paints and Coatings|Reinforcement, improved durability and impact resistance|
|Construction|Improved strength and durability of building materials, safe alternative to asbestos|
##  How Wollastonite Provides Plants with Ca and Si

Wollastonite reacts with Water and Carbon Dioxide in the soil to form Calcium Bicarbonate and Silicon Dioxide.
- CaSiO₃ (Wollastonite)+2CO₂ (carbon Dioxide,)+H₂O (Water)→Ca(HCO₃)₂ (Calcium bicarbonate)+SiO₂ (silica)

### Calcium
- Calcium bicarbonate  (Ca(HCO₃)₂) is unstable and fairly easily decomposes to Limestone (CaCO₃):
		- Ca(HCO₃)₂ (Calcium bicarbonate)→CaCO₃ (Limestone)+  CO₂ (carbon Dioxide) + H₂O (Water)

- Soils with a pH below 7 (acidic soils) contain hydrogen ions (H+). These hydrogen ions react with the Limestone (CaCO3) to form Calcium ions (Ca2+), Water (H2O), and Carbon Dioxide (CO2).
	- CaCO3 (Limestone) + 2H+ (hydrogen ions) → Ca2+ (Calcium ions) + H2O (Water) + CO2 (carbon Dioxide)
### Silicon
- Silicon Dioxide slowly breaks down into Silicic Acid, which plants absorb. This process is influenced by soil pH, temperature, and microbial activity.
	- SiO2 (Silicon Dioxide) + 2H2O (Water) → H4SiO4 (Silicic Acid)

- Plants absorb Silicic Acid from the soil solution through their roots.

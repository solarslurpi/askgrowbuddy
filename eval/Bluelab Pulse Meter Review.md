# Intro

 This is the Bluelab Pulse Meter. I'm very excited to be able to add it to our lineup of products at KISS Organics and we have the best price online. This meter is not for everyone, but here's what it does. It measures moisture,

 conductivity or EC and temperature directly in the root zone with one click. It connects to the Blue Lab Pulse app to view, analyze and store all your measurement data. The app is available in English, Spanish, Dutch, German and Korean. And it has a built-in depth gauge to get consistent measurements with every reading. It works in soil, coco coir, nutrient solution and living soils. So how and why would you want something like this for your garden? Well, first off, it will quickly measure moisture levels. It is waterproof, unlike the BlueMatte moisture meter, and I love that I can get a reading immediately instead of having to wait for a while between readings. This means I can use one meter and check multiple pots or beds in a matter of seconds to see how evenly I'm watering or if I have any dry spots or if any containers got missed when watering.

# Soil EC

 Secondly, it tells me EC. EC is a measurement of electrical conductivity in your soil, which is a good way of seeing what level of fertility you have in your media. Cations like calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and ammonium, as well as anions like sulfur, chloride, nitrates, and bicarbonates are all salts that when dissolved in solution in soils will carry electrical charges and current. Now too high of an EC will potentially put osmotic pressure on your roots and that can be bad. So it's about getting it into the proper range and we really want a soil test so we can determine what is making up the salt concentration in our soil. But it will give us a rough idea of fertility in our soil mix if we know all our inputs. And staying within certain EC ranges, typically 0.7 to 2.8, will allow for good microbial activity and important soil processes like respiration and decomposition. Keep in mind that several factors can affect soil EC such as moisture content, soil structure, and the presence of dissolved salts. As the soil moisture increases, so will your EC. And lastly, I get an idea of temperature. Cold root zone temperatures can inhibit plant growth and the uptake of many essential nutrients like phosphorus and too high of soil temps can make it easier for plant pathogens to grow. I'm currently calibrating it with my blue mat moisture meter and will be comparing it with an aerometer here soon.

# Pulse App

 Okay, so this is the iPhone app that comes along with it. You can use it on Android as well though. The app is called Pulse. Again it's available in multiple languages and essentially I just push the button on the Pulse meter itself to connect it. It connects quickly via Bluetooth and then at that point I don't have to keep reconnecting with every calibration or every photo I want to take. I just click the measure button and then I can go in as I'm doing here and I can add a photo to that measurement as well as any notes that I may want. So here's a good place I can add say the VPD in the room at the time, any pest pressures I may be dealing with, when I watered and keep track of all of that right here in the app. So it's a nice little kind of like journal in some ways. Now this could get complicated in a facility where you have multiple plants and things like that but you do have the ability to export the data. So if you had a facility for example you could just measure one room, export that data and then keep the files somewhere else associated with it. But since I just have them using it in this room I can go back through historically and look at my notes and anytime you see an orange dot there next to the recording that tells me that I took a picture or added extra notes. So that's a really handy feature to quickly go back through and look at what was going on in the room at that time for tracking things. So again not for everyone but if you're into data this is a really cool tool that could potentially help you in your grow. And so you can see what I was doing here was I was comparing the 35% moisture in this case correlated approximately with my blue mat moisture meter. At that point it said I was at about 75 MBar. Now I've been playing around with this for a little while and getting a bunch of measurements to kind of get an idea of EC and moisture level and how those things relate to say something like the blue mat moisture meter. And I find I probably want to be around 35 to 45% is a moisture range. And that probably correlates to about 80 let's say 70 to 90 in terms of MBar ratings. But one other cool feature here I can now export this data I can send it to someone or I can save it to a file or email it to myself. And I think that's another really great feature associated with this. You can configure it based on the type of media you're using. In this case I just configured it to a mixed media for living soil.

 Well that's it, that's the Bluelab Pulse Meter. I hope I covered the pros and cons as well as why someone might want to use this tool in their garden. Thanks for checking out my review and you can go to kisorganics.com to learn more or order one for yourself. Thanks!

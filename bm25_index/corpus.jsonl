Perhaps that labeling convention was designed to mislead. In any event, here\u2019s how to calculate the truth of the matter. The atomic weight of one atom of nitrogen is 14 and a little bit. (That number, 14, is not exactly right; the atomic weights I provide are rounded off, making them easier to work with.) And the atomic weight of one atom of oxygen is about 16. So in NO3 there are three atoms of oxygen and one of nitrogen, the percentage of nitrogen is computed this way: 3 x atomic weight of oxygen = 3 x 16 = 48 plus atomic weight of nitrogen (14) gives: the atomic weight of NO3: 48 + 14 = 62. The atomic weight of N divided by the atomic weight of NO3 gives the percentage of elemental nitrogen in nitrate: 14/62= 22.5%. Calculating soil remineralization is more straightforward if you use only the elemental weights. By the way, the fertilizer industry does the same fiddle with phosphate and potassium (oxide). Elemental phosphorus is labeled as phosphate, P2O5, which is only 44% elemental P, and potassium is normally labeled as K2O, which is only 83% potassium. To make your life easier, the worksheets contain a table of fertilizers showing their contents in elemental form. When the table says seedmeal contains 6% N, it means elemental N. If that 6% N is in nitrate form, NO3, you would figure 6 divided by .22, giving you 27% nitrate nitrogen.", "id": "7c97b79f-2fd4-4640-856e-60f803995e95"}

It is designed to extract nutrients off of colloids. Living Soils don't have a lot of colloids. It's basically a lot of organic minerals floating around in a substrate.  Rather the molecules organic-rich media common in cannabis cultivation, which often includes materials like peat and coir fiber, constituting more than 25-30% organic matter. This test, which performs an acidic extraction at a pH of around 2.5, may not provide accurate nutrient assessments for these types of soil due to its small sample size (approximately 5 milliliters) and the heterogeneous nature of potting soils.\n\nBill points out that the M3 test will dissolve lime that hasn't been processed by microbes yet.  Because of this, we are seeing very high values for CEC, but what we are really seeing is excess Calcium caused by the disintegration of lime by the M3 acid mixture.\n\nFor these modified soil mixes, it's advisable to establish specific nutrient sufficiency levels rather than depending on the standard values given by the test. This is particularly relevant for elements like calcium, which can be overestimated in mixes with added lime that dissolves during testing, leading to falsely elevated calcium readings.\n\nIn contrast, the saturated paste test, which evaluates water-soluble nutrients, is more appropriate for these modified mixes. It offers a more accurate reflection of nutrients available to plants by mixing soil with a neutral water solution and measuring the nutrients leaching into the solution.\n\nFor cannabis growers using living soils that are richly amended and reused, it's also crucial to monitor the nutrient balance in irrigation water. Over time, the soil's nutrient profile can align with that of the irrigation water, highlighting the importance of regular water quality checks and adjustments in tandem with soil testing.", "id": "1a5cbb32-9ec0-4493-9a4e-42f669a40f6e"}

McKibben emphasizes that the paste test becomes the primary tool because it's a water extractable solution reflecting what plants see. The process involves the lab taking a soil sample, typically about 200 grams (vs 5 grams used for Mehlich), and mixing it to a pancake batter consistency. The sample is then left to sit for 24 hours before the water is vacuumed off and run through an analysis such as ICP, just like the extract solution for the Mehlich test.

As organic matter decomposes, it transforms into humus, a substance nearly indistinguishable at a microscopic level. This process happens regardless of the original type of organic matter, be it plant material or any other organic form. Humus is notable for its significant biological capacity and its ability to hold on to nutrients, known as cation exchange capacity (CEC). The continuous breakdown of organic matter into humus implies that higher organic matter content in soil leads to more humus formation over time.\n\nIn discussions about soil tests, particularly for peat or cocoa mixes used in cannabis cultivation, Bill emphasizes the contribution of humus to the soil's CEC . He suggests that it's the humus in the organic matter, rather than just the organic matter itself, that significantly contributes to the soil's exchange capacity. This understanding highlights the specific role of humus in enhancing the soil's ability to hold onto and exchange cations, a crucial factor in nutrient management and soil health assessments\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.", "id": "c54b9229-032c-4b3b-96f6-55b9bcfd8d39"}

When examined under a microscope, peat reveals a substantial degree of biological activity, which is highly advantageous for organic cultivation practices. This aspect of peat underscores its value in creating a living, active soil environment. Additionally, the implications of using peat in soil mixes, especially when combined with other components such as agricultural lime, are significant. The incorporation of finely textured agricultural lime into peat-based soil mixes can influence soil test outcomes, particularly in terms of free calcium detection. This is especially relevant if the lime hasn't been fully cycled by the soil's microbial processes, highlighting the complexity of interactions within peat-containing soil mixes.\n\nFurthermore, peat's role in soil health extends beyond its initial state, as it undergoes a transformation over time. As peat breaks down, it evolves into a more concentrated form of organic matter, eventually becoming humus. This progression significantly enhances the soil's cation exchange capacity (CEC). Initially, peat might not exhibit high exchange capacity, but as it continues to decompose and concentrates, it reaches a stage where its ability to hold and exchange nutrients is maximized. This transformation is crucial in improving the soil's CEC, as humus, the end product of decomposed peat, holds nutrients more effectively. This process, occurring over an extended time scale, marks the transition of peat into a stable organic matter form, significantly contributing to the soil's nutrient-holding capacity\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.", "id": "426fb699-6e56-43f5-8e4a-16823bb39682"}

Soluble salts include a combination of cations and anions, such as ammonia, nitrate, sulfur, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. High levels of soluble salts can cause plants to expend extra energy to absorb water. If the concentration of salts is higher outside the plant's roots than inside, it can pull water away from the roots, which is not ideal for plant health. Therefore, it's important to monitor soluble salts because they are indicative of nutrient concentration\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe conversation also touches on the potential inaccuracy of pH measurements due to the presence of salts. Salts, being typically pH neutral, shouldn't change the pH. However, they observe that pH can increase due to high salt concentrations, raising concerns about the accuracy of pH readings above seven\u200b\u200b.\n\nMaintaining moisture in the soil is crucial as it can prevent the concentration of salts from becoming problematic. Allowing soil to dry out can lead to increased salt concentrations, which can harm plant health. An irrigation system that keeps water levels high can help mitigate issues with soluble salts\u200b\u200b.\n\nBill stresses the importance of water testing, as the composition of the water used for irrigation can impact soil health over successive cycles. High levels of certain elements like sodium or calcium in the water can lead to an accumulation of these elements in the soil, which can affect the soil pH and overall nutrient balance\u200b\u200b.\n\nChlorides and bicarbonates in irrigation water are also points of concern.

This negative charge allows them to attract and hold positively charged ions (cations) like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and Sodium. Here's a breakdown of how this works:\n\n1. **Surface Charge**: Colloids, especially clay minerals and organic matter like humus, possess a net negative charge on their surfaces. This charge is inherent in the molecular structure of the colloids.\n    \n2. **Attraction of Cations**: The negatively charged sites on the colloid surfaces create an electrostatic attraction for positively charged ions (cations) present in the soil solution. This is akin to how magnets attract opposite poles.\n    \n3. **Exchange Sites**: The cations are not permanently bound to the colloids but are held loosely enough that they can be exchanged with other cations in the soil solution. This is crucial for plant nutrition, as it means that nutrients can be held in the soil against leaching but are still available for uptake by plant roots.\n    \n4. **Dynamic Equilibrium**: There's a constant dynamic exchange occurring where cations are being absorbed onto the colloid surface and released back into the soil solution. This process is influenced by the concentration of cations in the soil solution and the affinity of the colloid for specific cations.\n\nColloids assist in water retention in soil due to their small size and large surface area, which allow them to absorb and hold water molecules effectively. Here's how this process works:\n\n1. **High Surface Area**: Due to their minute size, colloids have a large surface area relative to their volume. This expansive surface allows more space for water molecules to adhere.\n    \n2. **Water Adhesion**: Water molecules are polar, meaning they have a slight positive charge on one side and a negative charge on the other. The negatively charged surfaces of colloids (especially clay and organic matter like humus) attract and hold onto these water molecules through electrostatic forces.\n    \n3. **Water Film Formation**: The water adheres to the surface of the colloids, forming a thin film. This film retains moisture in the soil, making it available for plant roots.\n    \n4. **Porosity and Soil Structure**: Colloids, particularly organic ones, can improve soil structure by creating more porous spaces within the soil. These spaces allow for better water infiltration and retention, as well as air movement, which is vital for root health and microbial activity.\n    \n5. **Reduced Leaching**: By holding water, colloids can also reduce the leaching of water-soluble nutrients. The water held by colloids stays in the root zone longer, which increases the availability of these nutrients to plants.", "id": "30b17b4d-06d0-4999-9c9b-3e6932a09774"}

Humus, rich in negatively charged sites, is instrumental in cation and anion exchange processes, facilitating the retention and release of nutrients essential for cannabis growth. It plays a critical role in nutrient cycling by holding onto cations like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, and to a lesser extent, anions like nitrates and phosphates, making them available to plants as needed. This property of humus significantly influences the soil's ability to support healthy cannabis plants, ensuring a steady supply of nutrients.\n\nIn the context of cannabis farming, where accurate nutrient management is critical, SOM, and particularly humus, are multifaceted in function. Beyond nutrient exchange, humus improves soil structure, enhances water retention, and provides a conducive environment for beneficial soil microbes. These microbes, in turn, assist in nutrient uptake by cannabis plants, crucial for their physiological and metabolic activities. Humus also acts as a natural buffer for soil pH and helps in mitigating the impact of harmful substances and heavy metals. The dynamic and complex nature of SOM, shaped by environmental conditions, soil type, and agricultural practices, requires careful management to optimize its benefits for cannabis cultivation.

There are a couple of things that one must consider when reading a soil report to make recommendations for change. First, the soil collected for the test should be a representative sample of the entire area. It will represent both the high and low fertility areas, now combined into a good average. Secondly, depth of the soil sample will affect the outcome of the test and tells you nothing of the nutritional levels at the various depths of the sample. Many assume that once the report comes back that the level of nutrition reported by the lab is constant through the sampling profile. Nothing could be further from the truth, especially samples in minimum or no tillage areas. Without thorough mixing, nutrients applied to the surface of the soil will move at different rates and depths depending on the solubility and chemical interactions. Phosphorus, for example will move normally less than a half an inch in the soil because of its highly reactive nature. Nutrient stratification will not be a problem for plant growth, providing root activity is maintained in that area and the nutrients are mobile in the phloem of the plants. In the phloem of the plant, nutrients can move up or down depending on the need. If the soils go dry in these high fertility zones and root activity ceases, deficiencies will likely occur. There is one nutrient that soil stratification is a real problem, and that is calcium. Calcium is primarily xylem mobile. This means it travels through the plant in the water transport system and moves upward almost exclusively. Calcium, which is needed for cell wall development, cannot be translocated from roots higher in the soil profile where calcium is in excess to roots lower in the soil profile needing calcium. Most lime samples that we have analyzed are only 5% soluble at a pH of 7.0. Liming soils with a relatively low pH will increase the solubility of the lime only if the lime is adequately incorporated. Lime left on \nthe surface will rapidly increase the pH at the surface and lower the solubility of the lime to approximately 5%.", "id": "d7186d26-c6c8-4f65-a4a3-27fd5b35be20"}

Ideally it would be best to collect soil samples that are located the farthest from any type of fertilizer application. Adjusting soil fertility is in no way a short, quick and easy trip, but rather a continual journey. It is much the same as a pilot who sets out to fly across the country to a certain destination far away. The pilot must continually adjust the direction of the plane to compensate for wind and storms along the way. Most fertilizers that are applied these days are quite soluble and when there has been a couple of inches of rain or irrigation, the fertilizer will dissolve. Until an equilibrium of  nutrients is reached in the soil, the test data can be affected. Even though the application may only be one nutrient\u2014for example, potash, it can increase the level of other nutrients in the soil test. The dissolved potassium may act as an extractant and displace cations such as calcium and magnesium off the soil colloids. The depths of soil sampling can also vary depending on the crop being grown. My rule of thumb is sample to the depth of the main root mass. If the root mass is shallower than it should be, two samples may be the best option. The first sample depth should go to the existing level of the root mass and the second sample would continue to the desired root growth depth. This would allow you to determine if the lower depth has some deficiency or toxicity present which is restricting root development. \n\nThe dry weight of soil (sandy loam) in 1 inch = 330,000 lbs. per acre. \n\nOne of most important sampling techniques is controlling the sample depth. Many times I get asked a question about interpreting soil sample results such as, \"What might have caused the soil values to have such a significant drop or increase from the previous sample?\" My first thought when asked this is about sample depth. Research has found that there is a 17% variable when your sampling depth varies by only an inch from the previous sampling depth (when done at a 6 inch depth) It is impossible to plot the nutritional direction of a field, golf green or fairway if the depth is not controlled. Samples tend to show a significant drop in their nutrient levels from one year to another, in spite of fertilizer maintenance programs. This is generally due to a lack of consistency in sampling depth. This raises a concern I have noticed that has been rapidly increasing as agriculture moves to more and more conservation tillage and no-till. This concern is already quite obvious in many turfgrass samples that I have observed. This problem occurs as a result of the stratification (or layering) of nutrients.", "id": "ad862693-ae8a-4007-90d8-343288ec5ce0"}

It's driven by the transpiration stream, which is water evaporating from the plant's leaves, pulling water and dissolved nutrients up from the roots. Nutrients like nitrogen (N) and calcium (Ca) often move predominantly via mass flow.\n    \n2. **Diffusion** is the process by which nutrients move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration in the soil. For nutrients that are not readily soluble in water, like phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), diffusion is a key transport mechanism.\n    \n3. **Interceptive Root Growth** involves the physical interception of nutrients by the growing root system. This method is significant for nutrients that are immobile in the soil, like zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu), where the roots grow to access the nutrients.\n    \n\nThis table shows the means (mass flow, diffusion or interceptive root growth) by which nutrients are taken up through the roots. This table also shows, with the exception of copper and iron, that most nutrients are picked up out of the liquid solution by either mass flow or diffusion. The mass flow nutrients that are anions (negatively charged ion) are nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), boron (B) and molybdenum (Mo). The cations (positively charged ions) calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are more free to move in solution and travel longer distances whereas other nutrients such as phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and manganese (Mn) move very little in solution. The later nutrients typically move from areas of high concentration to low concentration, but can bond quite readily in clays and with other nutrients which reduces their mobility.\n\nThe other very critical factor to consider is how do most of the nutrients move within the plant once the roots have taken them up. Nutrients like calcium, boron and manganese travel primarily in the xylem or the water transport system of the plant. This is primarily in one direction and very dependent upon the evapotranspiration (ET) happening in the plant. Calcium, boron and manganese are necessary nutrients for root development\u2014especially calcium as it needs to be in contact with the growing root. Nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus on the other hand can travel freely in the phloem.

The expansion of urban areas blankets the earth with concrete and asphalt, not only reducing the ground's natural absorption capacity but also altering local climates through the urban heat island effect. These impermeable layers channel water toward unsealed soils with increased force, making these areas more susceptible to sealing. In agricultural contexts, the intensification of farming practices, including the use of heavy machinery and high-frequency tillage, compacts the soil and exacerbates the sealing process, which can diminish soil fertility and crop yields.\n\nClimate change intensifies the concern, as it brings about shifts in precipitation patterns, leading to more sporadic yet intense rainfalls. The resulting larger water droplets strike the soil with greater impact, increasing the risk of sealing, especially in drought-hardened soils that are more prone to crusting. When the rain does arrive, it is more likely to run off than to be absorbed.\n\nTwo primary factors exacerbate soil sealing: water droplet size and soil texture. Soils with a high silt content are particularly vulnerable, as the fine particles compact easily under the force of falling water, such as rain or irrigation.\n\nThe soil texture triangle, a tool that classifies soil types based on their sand, silt, and clay percentages, provides insight into the resistance of various soils to surface sealing. According to the triangle, soil compositions with a higher sand percentage demonstrate a greater resilience to sealing, attributed to the larger particle size and consequent porosity, which allows for better water passage. In contrast, soils with a predominant silt composition tend to form a crust more readily when impacted by water, impeding the movement of water into the subsoil layers.\n![[Pasted image 20240109150545.png|500]]\n\n\n\nThe triangle is divided into sections that correspond to various soil texture classes such as clay, sandy clay, silty clay, clay loam, silt loam, sandy loam, loam, and so on. Each texture class is known to have specific characteristics in terms of water infiltration, nutrient availability, and suitability for different plant types.\n\nIn addition to the soil texture classes, the image also includes a legend indicating \"Droplet Sizes,\" with numbers 1 through 4.  Larger droplet sizes can cause greater compaction and sealing on the soil surface, especially in soils with higher clay content. From the image:\n\n1. **Soil Texture and Sealing**: Soils with a higher percentage of sand have higher resistance to sealing (rated as 3 or 4 on the scale), due to their larger particle size and greater porosity. These include sandy loam, loamy sand, and sand. These textures allow for better water infiltration and less compaction from the impact of water droplets.\n    \n2. **Impact of Silt**: Soils with higher silt content tend to have a lower resistance to sealing (rated as 1 or 2 on the scale), as silt particles are smaller than sand but larger than clay, leading to a tendency for compaction and crusting when wet.\n    \n3. **Influence of Clay**: Soils with higher clay content show a moderate resistance to sealing (varying across the scale from 1 to 3). Clay particles are very small, and when wet, they can compact tightly and form a dense layer that water struggles to penetrate. However, some clayey soils like clay loam have some resistance due to their mixed composition.\n    \n4. **Sodium Content**: High sodium levels in the soil can cause dispersion of soil particles, leading to a breakdown in soil structure and an increase in sealing. This is because sodium causes soil particles to repel each other, destroying the aggregates that help maintain pore space for water infiltration.\n    \n5. **Soil Coverage**: The use of mulch or other coverings can protect the soil surface from the direct impact of water droplets, preserving soil structure and preventing soil particles from dispersing and sealing the pores, thus maintaining better infiltration rates.", "id": "b4609e32-a8d1-44cc-8dcb-f5d1b3e19530"}

The specific purpose of the test must be kept in mind, and the completeness of the test desired. Read and follow applicable instructions carefully, the laboratory results will tell you only what is in the sample you send. It is the sample taker\u2019s responsibility to take a truly representative and unbiased sample of the field area in question. \n1. Soils that differ in soil type, appearance, crop growth, or past treatment should be sampled separately, provided the area can be treated separately. A soil map or crop response map can be of help in distinguishing areas and in recording location of samples. \n2. Several different tools \u2013 such as an auger, a soil sampling tube, or a spade may be used in taking soil samples. \n3. Scrape away surface litter. If an auger or soil sampling tube is used, obtain a small portion of soil by making a boring about 6 inches deep, or if plowing or tilling deeper, sample to tillage depth. If a tool such as a spade is used, dig a V-shaped hole to sample depth; then cut a thin slice of soil from one side of the hole. \n4. Avoid areas or conditions that are different, such as areas where fertilizer or liming materials have been spilled, gate areas where livestock have congregated, poorly drained areas, dead furrows, tillage or fertilizer corners, or fertilizer band areas of last year\u2019s crop. It is also advisable to stay at least 50 feet from barns, roads, lanes or fence rows. \n5. Because of soil variations, it is necessary that each sample consist of small portions of soil obtained from approximately 15 locations in the soil area. After obtaining these portions of soil, mix them together for a representative sample. Samples can be sent dry or wet. Place 2 cups of soil in a soil sample bag or ZipLoc bag. Where soil is very varied and especially where land leveling has been done, or erosion and deposition are severe, the field should be checked on a grid or incremental unit basis. \n6. After the sample has been taken, the soil sample bag should be clearly marked with your name, your address, and the sample ID on the outside of the soil bag. Make sure bags match Submission Worksheet. Keep a record for yourself of the area represented by each sample.", "id": "e90fbe95-782e-4c6a-a746-3704b9800cc5"}

Today we're going to be continuing our multi-part series on substrate pH with e-Grow. And today we're going to be focusing in on alkalinity and taking a little bit of a deeper dive in terms of alkalinity and water quality. Now the first step in looking at alkalinity and water quality and providing recommendations is knowing your water quality and testing annually. Your water will vary even in the most purest sense year to year and season to season. We see the most variability in surface water followed by well and city with being the least amount of variability. But also that season to season variation and well to well variation can occur, especially with wells. If you have multiple wells on site and there are different depths, we've seen variation there, as well as in the summer months when that aquifer starts to drain down a little bit or that surface pond starts to drain down, we see that variation starting to occur. Then knowing your alkalinity as well as knowing your pH. Your alkalinity will impact your substrate pH more than the pH of your water. And this is because alkalinity is essentially flowable lime that you're pouring into the pot. And how do we account for that in making changes into our growing practices in order to promote target pH? So looking at your water testing results, they can be reported in a variety of ways. They can be reported in calcium carbonate equivalents or milliequivalents or bicarbonates. So if we convert all of that into milliequivalents, and we can look at that all in the same field, but understanding what your lab's going to report it back to you in terms of looking at different recommendations in order to correct that. It can kind of be broken down into low, marginal, and high. When we have low buffering capacity, substrate pH may drop over time, and using a more basic fertilizer that's higher in nitrates can be used to help amend that. You have marginal where acid injection may help in a neutral or acidic fertilizer to maintain a substrate pH can be used. When we get high alkalinity, greater than four milliequivalents, acid injection is going to be required in order to drive that pH into the target range. So looking at target alkalinity ranges, there's not one size essentially fits all. For container size, it varies greatly. So looking at a very small container in a small root zone, we're going to be looking at a lower maximum alkalinity of about one milliequivalent. And then in four to six inch pots being the greater, we can have about two milliequivalents maximum. So kind of understanding what are you growing and kind of what target alkalinity you want to be shooting for is also very important. So low alkalinity water, this is the problem here in the southeast where we're not over limestone. And we have very limited buffering capacity in our water. If we have slight changes based upon our inputs, such as an acidic fertilizer, we can have low pH problems occurring due to that limited buffering capacity. And if you're in low alkalinity water, you really need to monitor that fertilizer type and its rate that you're putting in to prevent that pH drift over time. Then routine monitoring pH and EC in order to prevent that drift from getting too far outside of the ranges because you have that limited buffering. Now in high alkalinity water, you essentially have a lot of dissolved limestone within the water. And this measures the water's capacity to neutralize the acid. It's generally mainly bicarbonate and also carbonate as well. We're more likely to encounter high pH problems compared to low. So looking for that interveinal necrosis of the upper foliage associated with iron deficiency. Now options for high alkalinity corrections. You can blend water, whether that's 50% well and 50% surface or 50% reverse osmosis as well. Acidic fertilizers. Now an acidic fertilizer is generally going to be higher in ammoniacal nitrogen. then you can find the potential acidity or potential basicity on the guaranteed analysis of most of your commercial blends. So shown here, we have the potential acidity of 555 calcium carbonate per ton. Or in cases of higher alkalinity, you can utilize acid injection of either sulfuric nitric or phosphoric acid. And knowing your acid percentages when determining your injection rate is critical. And if you're going to be swapping between acids based upon making these different corrections, make sure that you know that acid percentage. And then going back to that point of substrate pH is greater impacted by alkalinity than your water pH. Shown here is grower A with a higher pH of 9.3, but a lower alkalinity of 1.4 milliequivalents compared to grower B has a lower pH of 8.3 in their water, but a very high alkalinity of 6.2. If we want both growers to achieve a target pH of 5.8, we can see that grower A with a much lower alkalinity is going to require much less acid compared to grower B. That's going to require almost four times because of that higher alkalinity in their water supply. It's kind of in summary and moving into the next part. Know and monitor your water quality. Speed the changes over time, test early and test often in order to see changes in your growing practices throughout the year. Let the fertilizer type to complement your water quality. If you're in low, low buffering capacity areas and low alkalinity, you have no buffering capacity, you're going to need to use something that's not nearly as acidic to prevent that change in pH over time. Compared to a high alkalinity area, using a more acidic fertilizer to remove some of the alkalinity in your water is important. Then high alkalinity corrective measures are required if you exceed one for very small plugs and two for larger containers. So understanding container size and your water quality is also very important. With that, I'd like to thank everyone. We'll be going into more in-depth and fertilizer type and rate in the next video. Thank you.", "id": "aeeedafa-1849-4fa9-9150-0ae1ee091dd6"}

But to start it off I think dude I get I get oh god I'm having some kind of issue with my YouTube stream okay back at it so I think I get two or three messages a week just random people that I've never met or that I've never interacted with before that say, what happened to Coop? And I think it's all just because I've been interacting with you a little bit and people are curious where you went and why you went. So I wanna start the interview off just by asking you why you left Instagram and feel free to be as descriptive or nondescriptive as you feel comfortable. Oh yeah, it was no big deal. It's just, you know, at my age, I worked to be set financially in my retirement. So I live in Oregon. One of the biggest industry here is tourism and then agriculture. So I don't have to go anywhere except 85 miles this way. I'm on some of those beautiful coasts, on the entire Pacific coast from Alaska down to South America. Go the other way, I'm at Mount Hood. You know, year round skiing. There's salmon fishing. And most of the people that I interact with on IG came from 12 years of first there was forums and then, this is all before social media as we define it today. You know, the weed forums, IC Mag, Grass City, I know they're a bunch of them, roll it up. I got banned from all of them so, because I pissed off the advertisers. And my favorite thing was to take when the digital cameras got better and better on the phones, go take a picture of a label that would have what was in it. And so I tell people how to make it yourself for about 10 cents on the dollar. And you know the boards are there to get more hits they get, the more they can charge your advertisers. And you got this clown in Oregon who wouldn't buy anything anyway, just, you know, pissing on their parade. But all I'm saying is, I mean, I've done this for so long, you know, I can answer, I already know the questions, put up a subject, you know, you're going to get this, you know, I heard somebody told me, you know, that kind of stuff. And, uh, just one night it was Sunday morning. I got up early. I usually get up like four o'clock to read and then take my dog out about five, five, 30. And so I went into my Instagram account and I just scrolled down and said, delete account. I went, yeah, why not? You know, I mean, it's not like the people I hang out with go, so what's your follower account now? Or, you know, what just, yeah, so enough wasn't enough. It was fun. But, you know, I'd rather go to the coast and play with my new drone and cameras. So to sum it up, it wasn't worth your time. Yeah, exactly. I mean, we all have to allocate our time as we see, as we feel is going to benefit physically, say it's an exercise program or spiritually by reading good books, trying to learn some new things. But I really don't want to discuss cation exchange capacity of core versus sphagnum peat moss ever again, for any reason. It probably doesn't make sense but yeah you know I just you know I you know and you know all the scams and not not with the people I'm just saying like who owns it you know know, Zuckerberg. It's sort of just that there's, there's the capitalism in the cannabis industry tends to leave a bad taste in your mouth when it's like, when it's so deeply rooted. And yeah, and it, you know, yeah, I was, it gets to be malicious. Yeah. I was active in the medical scene here when we got a pass back in 98 with the help of a great man. A guy that wrote, the emperor wears no clothes. Jack Carrera? Yeah. And his son had one of the oldest head shops here in Portland. And he was really active in getting the signatures, Jack, the father and the son. And at that time it was just medical, but we had one of the best, I thought, in the country that politically, okay, nothing's ideal. Then the law basically had 10 areas of diagnosis that would qualify you to get a car. And that could appeal to other states. And there were other states that did like me too's. We'll do Oregon's thing. So in Oregon increased it from eight diagnosis to 10. These other states followed. So that's how it worked. And you could have six plants in flower and 18 in high school, you want to call it and then clones didn't count. It counted as plant material, was a anyway, you get the idea. It was you know, it was workable. And nobody got screwed with here because we have a long history of growing cannabis in Oregon, going way back to the 50s. This is where the beach started at Reed College up in Southeast Portland. So there's always been a really active counterculture, whatever you wanna call it. And then you have families down in Southern Oregon near the California border. They've been growing for, I mean, families, going back three or four generations. So then this, uh, the push came, it wasn't passed by a voter initiative. It was passed by the legislature. Well, so the consultants and the money people just took it over. We were the only state that allowed outside money. So we had Asian banks, we had European banks, Canadian banks, and they accomplished in the first year, basically the price dropped almost 70%. So you planted it in May, whatever, with this kind of expectation, and it was, they still have stuff in the cold storage here. It's insane. And you did all that. And then you said, okay, every household, not person, but every household can grow four plants. And let's be honest, there were a lot of people that had medical cards, they got it, so they wouldn't, they'd be legal. So they just grow some personal. They weren't trying to finance a car. It was just so for plants, so I thought it was a, yeah, sure, why not? I know what I'm doing. Give me some 600 gallon smart pots in my soil and for plants, probably do better than a lot of these guys with their greenhouses. Excuse me, light assisted. Light assisted greenhouses, whatever the term is, yeah. Supplemental lighting. Yeah. I've been around the nursery sector. nursery section. I'm sorry. My connection is so bad. I think, I think my, my, when I talk, it lags for you guys. Cause I get a, I get a lag back and it seems like I'm not, it seems like I'm interrupting, but I'm not, I'm certainly not trying to. No, no, you actually sound fine. The one thing I tried to send you was if you have the YouTube stream going, kill it, cause that's competing with your bandwidth. Okay. You can even pop up. All right, I'm bouncing out of the chat, man. You can keep the chat going. Oh, how do I? I think you just, you can pop up the chat by hitting those three dots on the upper right. But anyway, out chat. Yeah, and then kill the video. Got it. Okay, cool. Thanks. So Jim, quick question. I love you know, people who can kind of give historical perspective. Can you talk about, you know, Southern California? I assume we're talking 60s and 70s. What were you smoking and then what was the evolution in the 60s to 70s to 80s to 90s of what you were seeing and where you were geographically from Southern California kind of migrating up the coast. Okay, well in the 60s and 66, 67, a group called the Brotherhood of Eternal Love was formed, it was made up of about half surfer, of course there were 13, it had to be 13, right? I think it was like six surfers and seven bikers. And this formed this group called the Brotherhood and they began importing, it was all imports. And so the first stuff that I thought was next to God was from Sri Lanka and Sativa of course that that thing didn't get going for another 11 12 years everything was sativa do you look at all the strains that get discussed of that era 60s and 70s tie stick Panama red you know, it was all sativa. And I'll leave that discussion for others. But to this day, if a person had legitimate heirloom Thai seeds, and knew what they were doing as far as breeding and not try to recreate something they read about on grass city. They probably make some really good money. Because of the psychoactive components of those strains that don't exist and I can never find. But anyway, they're completely gone now. Yeah, they're mongrelized. I used to have this as a tagline on my posting on the forums. Once you reduce a wolf down to a Chihuahua, there's no going back. All right, so you did it. You proved you could create a shitty strain. Good for you. You can make a domesticated dog in 10 generations from a wolf. Exactly. So in that period then, there was LSD flying around, a lot of stuff, purpleaze, excuse me, excuse me, Orange Sunshine would come later, but the stuff that was coming out of allegedly Bear, you know, and all of that whole scene. And so in Laguna Beach, guess who shows up once the LSD did, none other than Timothy Learyy and he became like this goober or something and his son managed the head shop in Laguna owned by the brotherhood called Mystic Arts World. It was a scene and with Timothy Leary came obviously a lot of federal surveillance and I remember walking down the beach and sitting there looking at the waves and a guy next to me, he's got white socks and wing tips and slacks on. That's not how you go to the beach. And there was just people crawling all over that place. And so it all came down. The Nixon administration, gonna bring law and order, get rid of the, he called them the hippie mafia. And so the party came apart, look it up sometime, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, 73, and look at how many were made members and associates that went off to federal prison. And then about that time, a little bit earlier, all that came to the LSD of, which it wasn't really, but Orange Sunshine. If you do your homework, you'll see that it was not LSD 25, but another ergo, Rice, Ry-ergo, AL Okay, okay Al al B and LSD is a LD these all came from dr. Hoffman I'm just saying because it was the other one was more stable and by this time they were shipping them out around the world. I Mean, you could go to Goa and buy Orange Sunshine for Christ's sake or, you know, wherever. And so things kind of mumbled and stumbled along, but in 76 Christmas, the brotherhood got in the first shipments that I ever saw of tie sticks. And they came in 10 kilo, let me see. Yeah, 10 kilo packs. So by the way, just quickly, I'm showing an Orange Sunshine graphic. Yeah, that's Nicholas. He was a writer for Orange County Register. And then from those, a series, a long multi-year series, he put an anthology here and excellent sources. And I'll leave it at that. I mean, he really was talking to the real players. Yeah, the real deal. So these tie sticks come in and so you got 20 pounds of sticks and then two pounds of untied tie that later became known as, I love this one, Buddha Buds. So that was like the first widely distributed cannabis that knocked you on your ass. I mean they're always like the surfers that smuggle stuff in in their surfboards. Okay, and there wasn't a scrutiny like there is today, you know. And so they could bring in three or four pounds maybe, but it wasn't like big shipments, but the tie stick thing opened it up. And people, once they had the real deal, you kind of set the tone for the next several years. And they were taking seeds down to Mexico, growing it there. And you can always tell because like the sticks, the actual sticks that was a section of bamboo were precision cut on the ones from Thailand. And then the string that tied the buds onto the stick was always silk. I mean, it was the real deal, but the stuff from Mexico, I don't know, looked like the sticks were cut with a pocket knife. And it was like something off of a sewing machine as far as the string, you know, that you got you got bastardized, I mean, right away. And that but that started I mean, there were things like look up Thai Power, the hash oil maker circa 1978. This one, yeah, you'll laugh at this. But you could, we had 10 of them. And you take the shake and remove the seeds, of course, and then you can take that shake and turn it into oil, such as it was. By today's standard, you guys will laugh your ass off, but you know, we were simple people. And this new agency called BB-8- Certainly, they've gotten more complex. Well, absolutely. I don't even, yeah, I don't get it, but yeah. I guess that the art of actually growing cannabis has kind of gone. So when this load of Thai came in, in Christmas of 76 that following summer 77 was the first time I grew outdoors and there you know there wasn't any books there wasn't fertilizer I don't know I I needed water. And we did 800 plants in, down off of San Juan Capistrano, in San Juan Capistrano area before it was all built up. It was a former avocado group. So it had well water and water distribution system. And of course, you know, since I'm here was still two years away. So I even heard the term. So an all pot had otherwise we couldn't have grown Thai. I mean, there was a shitload of seeds and Thai stick. And I think a lot of people that got growing probably started on tie for that reason. This was like the first cannabis that you got your hands on that you'd want to duplicate or replicate or something. And the seeds were right there. Did you start any genetics with any of those old tie seeds? Yes, that's the one that I'm known for the Tio That the mom of that f1 still around was the 76 Thai and a 1970 Kandahar right before I went off to save the world, to make the world safe for democracy for the army. Some guy says, hey, look what we found inside some of the kilos of hash. He gave me like five seeds or something and I just put them away. I didn't think about it. And then years back in the 80s, it was in the 83, 84 when I created this hybrid and I used the Kandahar seeds and got a male and the female came from the tie sticks. So that strain still remains intact 36 years later. I haven't tried to fix it. That's incredible. Yeah. That's why I kind of laugh and stuff like, well, you can't sell a dispenser because you're not registered. I say, why would I want to register? What? Yeah. OK. All right. Have fun. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the regulations shoot the patients in the feet more than anybody because it you know, they restrict access to true medication True, you know people that are growing through land-race strains Don't oftentimes want to Intermingle with the legal market. And so it leaves them in this gray area where you kind of have to be sub legal to access. Yeah. I support full legalization and that means no licenses, no permits. But anytime you set it up for this group, some house dominance over that group, it's open to corruption, pricing issues. And I remember when it first got legal couple, invited a couple of meetings and I did ask a very simple question. So who's the Adronomist here? You know, it's like, let me look that up. What does that mean? You know, on there. It was just, you know, it was just spreadsheets and you know, slacks and loafers. You know, it reminded me of, you me of the frat boys. Just annoying and too much money. You know the type. I've not been impressed with any of them. Yeah, gross store type. Well, yeah, they're gonna be on the cover of something or go to one of these silly conventions. They're not conventions, but... Oh, you know, like, uh, Hanacon, at least they got the name right. Uh... Indo Expo. It reminds me of Carnival Barkers, you know, you got those microphones on and, it's faster, it's bigger, it's... Give me a break. Mm-hmm. Use car great use car salesman. Yeah, or worse. The pillage show up on Saturday morning wanted to sell you a copy of wash tower. Yeah. I don't know. Just I don't get it. I mean, this is this is somebody's weird idea legalization. Down the end of my street is the main drag field town of suburb I live in, in Portland, and they have one of those tent, A-frame signs, you know, and it says ounces, $48. And I'm thinking, that's what we charged 42 years ago. I mean, give me a break. It was probably, you know, the, the Mexican swag I, Hey, I'll dig through the seeds and sticks at that price. Yeah. I don't know. What was there any, uh, you know, in the sixties and seventies Vietnam war kind of any influence of genetics coming in through the Air Force bases or the Naval States? Absolutely. I didn't know this till four or five years later on an episode of 60 Minutes, the news thing. They were talking about this group in San Diego that was busted and they started out moving tie sticks out of Thailand obviously on air force jets that would go back and forth to the mainland for whatever reason. So it was all inside job. And then once you get the the attention of the what do you call it? International money, then everybody's involved. You know, not a bunch of knucklehead. E fours and E threes working on the airport, Tarmacs in Thailand and wherever else, I mean, Cambodia. CIA was all, you heard of Air America, the one here in Portland that was a CIA contract, they're just, they weren't even numbered. They had them on display right here in McMinnville, Oregon. Yeah, you know, it's, there's the shadow government thing. It's not. It's not just paranoid. I mean, you have to have agencies, I guess it will do things that you can't, but I don't know, I'm not a, you know, strategist. Careful, Coot. You're getting into demonetization talk here. I just, hey, look, when Oregon passed what they passed, I'm not moving anywhere. You won't be finding me in Kansas or something or Nebraska. I grow four plants and you've seen my pictures. So you know, I'm not exaggerate when I tell you that for plants, I could easily pull 30 pounds. Give me my, my soil my, you know, 600 800 gallon pots. The reason we do that is that you want to line the bottom with the chain link fencing. And it's kind of a deterrent not much but somewhat of a turn against mold, voles, gophers, that kind of issue, you know. You know, I've had really luck. I started lacing my trenches and quarter inch um hardware f it's kind of not super mal but it keeps freaking eve it's as close as you can g but you fabric, but it's got quarter inch holes in it, so there's high drainage and stuff. And actually this is like a perfect segue for me to jump into the reason I got you on here, which is your soil mix, your inputs, your information on vermiculture. you're sort of like a one-stop shop grow, you know, knowledge source. And for that reason, I look up to you big time and I think a lot of people do because, you know, a lot of people just want to be growers. They don't necessarily want to be expert composters or expert lighting consultants. They just want to have a proper garden and you are the guy that crowns that mountain. So I want to get into that a little bit. And I wanted to start with barley. I think I got more questions from people wanting to know about barley than almost anything else, just because it's such a hot topic right now. Sure. And I thought because you know so much about it, I was hoping you could give us a little rundown on like, you know, the history and the uses of barley in the past and, you know, the types of barley and their significance and that sort of thing. Okay so I just want to lead off by saying I'm not trying to step on anybody's beliefs, religious or whatever. I'm going with science and that's the best I can do. So barley was the grain that turned the human race from gatherers to food producers. They could actually plant a seed, grow a plant, and harvest those seeds, keep some connection. So that was the very beginnings of the human race producing their own food. That was an important development because it allowed the human race to gather in cities. But anyway, you can see how that transitioned if you were in control of your feeding the masses. And when it was discovered that when you allowed the seed to ferment in water, and what a crude introduction to beer, I guess, people didn't die when they drank it. So in that process of brewing beer later, you think about it, more humans have died in our history over bad water than all the wars combined. So Barbie was at the core and then it branched out into other grains in other parts of the world like rice in Asia and India and China. As diverse as sorghum in parts of Africa. And then of course you have the whole maize crops in North America. I mean, those were like tectonic changes because people could live longer because they had a relatively stable source of food. And the side effect, if they made this brew and allowed it to ferment, people didn't die when they drank the water. So we can trace our history back. The side industry of that was bread. Barley was at the core of bread baking. We didn't arrive for another 500 years. Literally this barley, you could say, or grains kind of were the core of our specialized evolution, like kind of where we were able to live longer and be healthier and grow bigger brains. Would you even? Well, there's a whole lot of things. Look at McKenna's work, Terrence and Dennis McKenna, Intelligent Eight and some of that. But that's yeah, I mean, it's lot of that's my thing but I think at the very least we can attribute the rise of civilization without getting into like getting better than that but where you had large groups of people to then focus their energy and become good at this or that like shipbuilding or you know there are all kinds of directions that it went in good and bad ways until the hunt probably wouldn't be on everybody's you know person you want to go have for dinner or something but so the way I got into it is I knew from bread baking, what we call artisan bread baking here in the United States, is this in particular, it's almost limited to French bakers. They add what they call what is called diastatic malt. I never questioned what it was. I couldn't tell you at that time what diastatic meant. I didn't even know what malt meant. I had some remote idea that it was old-fashioned ice cream drinks in the 40s or something. So one day I'm out hiking in one of our national forests up here, ancient forest, and there was a clearing, so I saw that I had some email and I just looked at it, see what it was. And then I started thinking about this diastatic malt thing. So I looked it up and it was barley malt. And what all malt means is that you allowed the seed to germinate. To germinate as opposed to sprouting. There's a difference I learned. What's the classification? Is it like less than a quarter inch or half an inch? Yeah, as soon as they're actually in the commercial malting houses, and here's how how precise it is Even the big companies when they were in business anheuser-bush Subcontracted their malting malting houses There isn't any food item that humans Consumed that is done with the amount of precision is malting grain because you might like a shitty beer like some beer that's not very good, we'll say. But damn it, you want to taste the same when you go on vacation, right? It's gotta taste the same in Miami as it does in Portland. And the only way that you can control that phenomenon is by having absolute scientific control over the malting process. And for example, the biggest malting operation in North America is Great Western Malt. And I believe they only have like four locations. One of those is here in Portland, well actually across the river in Vancouver, for the Asian market. So the beer that's made in China that comes from Oregon and Washington grown barley. This is Barley Central. You can look up the website barleyworld.org. That's a portal from Oregon State University. That's how big the crop is because the human race drinks a lot of beer. And you got to have good mop and high enzyme levels. And so when I started digging around the science on what enzymes were in these grains, the one that stuck out to me was to kite, kitesin. And because of its properties as far as a defense against insects in the soil just deconstructs the shell preventing the larva from developing but there's others in there like for protease for proteins urea, urea, phosphatase, phosphorus, you get the idea. There's over 360 different enzymes and approximately 50 identifiable strains of fungi and over 200 identifiable strains of bacteria. And in the soils, those enzymes in conjunctions with the microbes deconstruct the organic materials and it's their feces, exude, whatever you want to call it, that's what worms consume. And when it goes through their digestive tract, it's turned into castings and not manure. And those castings are covered literally with a slime of calcium carbonate. That's why people who use worm castings, you'll never hear them complaining about pH. It arrives correct pH in the form of the worm castings. Hey, you're okay. You just gave out a lot of information. I want to end all of it really, really good. I want to take a step back and identify one of the things that you started talking about, because I don't think I fully understand it. So how do the enzymes like amylase and cellulose and chitinases and phosphatases and how do these things on a molecular level break down sugars or proteins and stuff like that? And just quickly, before you start, Ken, I want to troubleshoot your audio is a little choppy sounding. Could you kill the earphones, like disconnect the Bluetooth and see if just talking into the iPad changes that. Okay, how's that? All right, keep talking. Okay, so I'm looking at the Magic Mouse box I picked up from Apple Store yesterday. All right. That does sound a little better. Let me do something real quick. Hold on. I want to turn the air pads off. Okay. We need our like hold music right now. I picture an office space when that when that lady is answering the phone. Thank you for calling, please hold. Thank you for calling, please hold. Okay, just to make sure I'm putting them in the case, that should shut them. These are new, so bear with me. Yeah, no, actually this is sounding better. Okay, so yeah, they turned off, okay, um, so the enzymes are cofactors that work in conjunction with the microbes to accelerate the deconstruction so amylase converts the simple starches in in the plant material right into a form that simple sugars that the roots can absorb, because roots have to work on a molecular level on everything. They don't absorb or accumulate compounds. So when we add, as an example, a calcium carbonate, so you have one calcium ion, you have one carbon ion, and then you have three oxygen. Well, those are broken apart. Does that make sense? The plant doesn't take up calcium carbonate as a compound. Yes, that totally makes sense. Okay. So your your A's your reason to go ahead. No, in the case of your A's. That's where we get the ammonia smell obviously and poorly constructed compost. A way to fix that is to add a lot of barley to your marginal compost and move it from a six to an eight or maybe nine with just the addition of barley malt. And some of the other enzymes in there, the protein, all the things that were in there, you're probably starting with manure, that's a most typical, probably the patholyse resistance, is to start with a manure or manure-based compost, add the barley, and now it's ready to go through the worm bins, because you've be those agents which are go colonies. I see. So cert enzymes then that suppress and then certain enzymes colonies? No, because worms, contrary to the mythology, worms don't have, can't eat anything. They lack teeth and more importantly, they lack a stomach. What they have is a digestive tract that works with other enzymes that they create and some that come from the materials as it's moving through, they also exude enzymes to trigger specific microbial reactions. And in that, what they do is they suck in the bacteria, their manure, their exudes, whatever term we wanna use here. So in that tract, in the worms digestive tract, through enzymes, that manure now is converted to castings, not all worms create castings, that's where they end. There's composting worms and then there's earthworms. You can't keep earthworms, they'll die within a week. On the same token, if you put composting worms into your garden, for reasons that escape me, their chances of surviving or thriving are really marginal. It's best to put them in the worm bin, because that's where the action is, and get that item perfected. If you get to a point where you have more worms than you know what to do with, let me explain how fast worms reproduce. Okay, you're never gonna have perfect conditions, but let's say that you did. A pound of worms today would be a thousand pounds a year from today. A thousand pounds. Every worm produces two cocoons a week and each cocoon has four hatchlings and they're sexually mature in six weeks. So I mean think about it. And they live four and a half to five years. You said you know perfect conditions don't exist anywhere on earth, but even under, you know, moderate conditions, they're going to produce moderately close to that and do really well. And then, so you said something that was really cool, and I wanted to talk about that too, which was you sort of said in one way or another, that which benefits the soil bed does not necessarily benefit the worm bin. In that the worms aren't necessarily gonna be as happy in your soil bed as they will in a worm bin where there's a really high level of organic matter, like above 50%. And you have really, if you're doing things correctly, which isn't difficult, you have extreme levels of microbial action. And by adding barley, okay, one of the, not complaints, but one of the facts that there's always pros and cons of any process as we approach to make our soils better. Composting, vermicomposting, and vermicomposting is definitely a bacteria driven process so that you can make the argument, a ferroin, that it's lacking in fungal and other microbes. And that's fairly accurate. That can easily be resolved with the addition of barley. We're getting over 50 strains of fungi that can be identified, not just these silly plate counts. Well, I saw something moving, so going to count it. Okay I mean like a legitimate you know plate count with a real with a real microscope not one from Toys R Us. And yeah like you know like I mean I wouldn't say is you don't need an electron microscope but you need something that's more than just 20 or 50 X. Yes. But I'm not even sure that's important. Okay. This is a real life, real world example. The guy that I was his first customer to answer and add in Craigslist, Doug at the Northwest Red Worms. I was the first person to show up. And that time, he sold worms and made really beautiful worm out of plywood boxes for your patio or what have you. And he's really tight. He doesn't buy anything. Everything that goes on his piles of manure is throwaway stuff from the produce houses and stuff like that. He's also on a call list for the Oregon and Washington State Police, their highway patrols that if there's an accident, and it's a food item, he's one of the people that can be called a salvage, you know, come out and get it off the highway. So one, what a cool thing. I never even have thought about that, that like, you know, come o the highway. So one, wha I've seen like orange, li trucks full of oranges. I toppling over on the highw like what happens? Do the there? But no, there's like a guy that collects them and compost. And then your build. Okay. So the trucking company gets a bill from the state after they pad the books from the contractor. So you own the truck. So you go out and get them off the highway. You charge. I'm just throwing out a number 10 grand. The state's going to tack on another five. So the owner of the trucking company gets a bill for 15 to 20,000. Anyway, so he calls me Sunday morning at seven o'clock. I just buy worms from the guy. He goes, do you think about Great Western Malt? I said, well, yeah. He says, well, I got a whole truckload of it off the highway last night after he loaded. Anyway, he got an accident within three miles after he got a full load ongoing wherever back east. So I go over there and I see two row barley, the real stuff that you would buy at a home brew store or go to small microbreweries. This would be a product of that quality. That's the stuff I just paid $2.10 a pound for when really you shouldn't be paying more than a dollar, right? Correct. Yeah, you gotta go to a home brew store. Even though I went to a home brew store, you know, I made a post about this. Some people just suck at business and just because you go to a local guy who kind of knows his stuff doesn't mean it's perfect. So, but nonetheless, source it locally. I'll send you some resources, National. Because, you know, can you imagine how much barley is malted every year? I mean, and it's going all over the world. You can't even comprehend it. They have my picture in the board of directors room, a garland of flowers around it because I created a new market for them. The oldest brew store in America is here in Portland. And the first time I went in there, it said I wanted barley malt. And should I get it ground up, because I want to use it to feed plants. And these guys are looking at me like, okay. They've been around for a hundred years. And, but anyway, so yeah, when I first went in there, they were selling like a hundred pounds a month of organic two row. And within six months they were selling 250 bags a week. I thought who mailed orders? Barley, you know what I mean? Tell me a city in America that has more than a thousand people that doesn't have a brew store. Anyway, whatever, you can get a feed store too. So don't worry about, you know, like- Dude, I don't have a Bruce for, I don't have a Bruce store near me. I had to drive an hour to, to Auburn. I'm in, uh, I'm in like Eldorado County and in my class, reveal diamond Springs area. Well, like I said, the first Bruce stored America was here in Portland. We have the brewers festival every year, the organic brewers festival. One time before this coronavirus, there were 55 breweries within the Portland metro area, 55. I mean, in the Portland metro area. Not all of them good. I mean, who puts raspberries in their beer or blueberries or, you know, whatever? The Germans from the other have others like seltzer. There's like these shitty seltzer beers everywhere that it's kind of like the weed in the dispensaries. I mean, it's like, who smokes this shit? But interestingly, I feel like there's an explosion in kind of hop cultivar varietals that are adding kind of new kind of taste profiles to beer. You know, hops are interesting. There's currently two major areas of the United States. One's in Washington on the east side of the Cascades which is like high desert and then there's one down near me about 15 miles near Mount Angel. Like they have the annual Oktoberfest and this is is hop country. They even has a railhead. I mean, that's how big the hop industry is. And you go to Europe, Germany, and all over because the hops here. And I want to put a myth, kill a myth. That's my that was my big focus for the morning. So but anyway, hops are you drive around, they're grown very in unusual ways. They're grown on strings that are attached to wood frames. And so you'll be like, oh, I don't know 20 feet long thing of a cola 20 feet long. And those are harvested and they go into the drying rooms and and then are not just dried but then cured, dried under specific conditions to bring out their their flavors. And because it's I forget the name of the plant, but I know the last part is sativa. There was a myth floating around years ago that you could cross cannabis with hops. And let me explain the word sativa. It was first created and used by the British Empire in the late 19th century, specifically in, especially India. So any wild plant was indica. So as a direct in the neem tree, it would have the name indica, but it has nothing to do with another plant called indica. That makes sense.? It was just a way, like a group classification, a wild plant from India. And the word sativa means- Yeah, and if you kind of examine, if you kind of examine the nomenclature of botany, you will see sativa so many times that you will get numb to hearing it and it no longer has that novelty oh sativa on it i mean it's like everywhere all it means sativa simply means that a seed was put in the ground by a human and it was planted it was cultivated so like for example alfalfa is medigo sativa, right? That doesn't mean you can cross it with a haze, or, you know, some silliness or you could, OG or the, you know, 918. So but yeah, I mean, so yeah, the word sativa just means cultivated. That's all. And yeah, you're right, you get in the world of botany and I would imagine, especially in grains and such, that sativa probably represents 70% of having that part of their identifier. But then, you know, then- Yeah, it's, sorry, go ahead. No, go ahead. I was just gonna just gonna second that, that it's it's everywhere. It's oh yeah, 70% seems like an accurate number. Yeah, I mean, we start talking legumes and grains, not all but some, you know, I mean, yeah, there were politics involved. I mean, there's a whole bunch of, yeah, the thing that how it got absorbed by the cannabis community is almost laughable. I mean, you call it whatever you want. But what if it was a wild sativa? Does that mean it's no longer a sativa? See what I'm saying? You know, when the word, the origin of the word was to mean cultivated. Somebody planted it. Physical effort. Put the seed and cover it with some soil and water. But whatever. So let's go back to Burma culture because here's the whole key to a good soil. Yeah, I wanted, I had a question about Amylase. Actually this comes from a buddy of mine and yours I believe. Jeremy on Instagram, his name on Instagram is Unwary Gundogs, really good guy, buddy that follows and highly active. He actually asked, what's the deal with like sugar alcohols, you know, as sugar gets broken down, as starches get broken down into sugars and then sugars broken down into alcohol, is there a risk of the alcohol damaging microbiology? And secondarily, is there a difference between a homogeneity of ingredients versus a top dress in this regard? Okay, well, let me state first of all, almost every seed contains amylase that I could possibly think of because it's a, think what goes on as a seed hydrates and then begins to germinate and create a tap root. Imagine all the physical changes as well as the enzymes change. As an example, a seed is encoded with enzymes to keep it inhibit its germination. Otherwise a drop of water and a seed would instantly, within a day or two two begin to germinate, that would be very problematic. You didn't store it, for example. So when you hydrate that seed either in water or in a wet soil, that activity begins where the seed begins to change this enzyme into that enzyme. So I just want to explain that it is an ongoing change as the taproot begins to emerge. And that's why you want a good rich soil, not a make believe soil from the garden store. If let's say that you could only afford some amount of legitimate worm castings, we'll say. If you just took your rooted cutting and surrounded it with a layer of worm castings and put that in the soil, that would be enough to give you a dramatic benefit and certainly a motivation to get busy and make more worm castings like the one you bought kind of thing. Because if you have good castings, your problems are over. Period. You've got an intense amount of microbial colonies that work in conjunction with the enzymes and cofactors to deconstruct materials into their molecular levels. And that's why adding pumice is a good idea because it has holes and we call nutrients sequestering. And so that's where when it gets into the soil mix finally, roots and especially mycorrhizal fund inoculations, those can get into the soil mix fin especially like Riesle fu Those can get inside those and remove those things th be wouldn't be touched by other thing is that brought up. Go ahead. Oh, barley is the only grain that produces both alpha and beta forms of amylase by the way. And that's important. Yeah. That's why you can make beer with a barley, but you, well, you can make beer. So just quickly, we have a special guest since you mentioned him. Can you see who just joined? Oh, Doug, Northwest Red. So anyway, keep going, because actually you're getting into something I was going to ask, which is, you know, is there something special and unique about barley where you couldn't really other grains couldn't do or can't do what it is capable of doing? No, as a matter of fact, I tell people all the time, if you go to your local brew store and they have oats, we'll say, malted oats on sale because they over ordered, buy it. I've purchased everything that was available at Steinbarts including rye, red wheat, white wheat. Oh, God, different forms of barley, oh spelt. And then I started out malting my own grains because I didn't know you could buy such a thing. I actually used to go to Bob's Red Mill and buy raw this and raw that and then do it in a mason jar with a lid. It was a great lids on it so I could breathe. And somebody said, why don't you just buy it? They make this stuff already? Oh yeah. So I never sprouted any seed since. That was over. Yeah, it's super convenient. When I walked into that, I ordered 100 pounds of barley and I walked into the guy's shop and he's like, come on back here. And he points to his mill and he's like, here's the mill. And so, you know, you just pour it in and it's the easiest, most convenient thing. Yeah. Before we move on with this topic, you brought up Pumice a second ago and it kind of paralleled with the comments. A buddy of the show, the other show that I'm on, Growing with My Fellow Growers and a buddy of mine, the American one, Tao, asks, can you elaborate on your take on Azomite? You have said in the past that you don't like it as much as other rocks and, and then he also asked if you could comment on the paramagnetivity of rock dusts. Okay, the only two that I know of, and I'm pretty confident on this one, the only two paramagnetic rock dust are Basalt and Granite, which is a subset of Basalt. The other ites, you know, your Bentonite, Zeolite, and Azomite. Now that's a brand name, Azomite. It's owned by a company in Utah. It's actual name, it starts with an M-O-M-I-E-T-E-I. And if you've ever seen French bread ovens, they're beehive shape with a tiny little door on the front where they move the breads in and out. They, this made out of this clay and they make wonderful bread ovens. I'm not sure how that plays out in the soil. But if you really want a hardcore science, go to a website, it's a not-for-profit called, Remineralize the Earth. And it has an archive that'll blow you away from around the world, studies by international groups, universities, and what have you. And like I said, it is a not for profit. And so you're not going to be ripped off or anything like that. And it's just really good science. And the premium, this is interesting, the two premium basalts on this planet come from Hawaii and Oregon, and it has to do with hardness. And I know that sounds counterintuitive, but the harder the material, the more benefit because it's not a question that microbes can deconstruct a piece of the salt isn't like that at all. But what can be produced is that the enzymes produced by the microbes, that's what is the benefit. Let me give you an example, chitosan. Chitin is found in a lot of things. It's in the walls of fungi, as an example. It's also in the shells of some anthropods, or all of them, lobsters, shrimp, crab, even the ones in the south, what they call those, the red ones, crawdads. In their shells, they have layers of chitin, which is a polysaccharides, like a second cousin to glucosamine. And the only thing that can deconstruct that material is fungi, but bacteria, some bacterias in a weak attempt to do that, create what scientists would call chitosan or chitinase, chitinase. Chitosan is produced that way. You take chitin and you hit it with massive amounts of bacteria and you get a commercial product called chitosan. Well, we get the, and so it's the chitinase that you want. The chitinase is what deconstructs the eggshells in the cell. So by adding barley, we're getting chitinase and you don't have to go through all the expensive getting crab meal or shrimp meal or lobster meal, what have you. You can use your good old limestone, hit it with a good amount of barley and you're dancing. Buy your barley. I love the idea that, I love to pretend that there is some fucking farmer out there that is using lobster meal on their, like they're like, I'll have lobster and steak tonight. And then they crush up their, like they're a sustainable lobster eater or something like that. Yeah. That's actually, you know, it's all shells on this planet are made from limes, excuse me, calcium carbonate. That's all limestone is accumulated seashells over millions of years. And so like there isn't a dime for the difference between using oyster shell, but it sounds cooler. That's why I started using it. And it was cheaper than limestone. That was the other reason. And it all comes out of San Francisco Bay by a company Pacific Pearl. And they put it in racetracks and stuff. And I mean, it was a big use for it, but it's not like the shells from Happy Hour at some restaurant. They're only about the size of your little finger now. There's some ancient critter. They've been hauling it out of there since the 20s. And first form and still goes on if you look at chicken feed will always have oyster shell in it. Well, the calcium carbon and that's what so these these are micro oysters like for like ancient micro oysters? Right. And they do it to keep the San Francisco dredge. Because otherwise, it's going to fit not with that. But that's just what you have to do that. And so when companies started back in the 20s, not only do they get paid for dredging, they now have a material they can work and they have a number of products and not the least of which is poultry. It makes the shells harder so there's less breakage in transportation and shipping them. And so we've been doing that for like 100 years. And then yeah, but it's all calcium carbonate, you know, and the only thing is that these certain seashells have this hyphen. Well, you look at the price of the crab meal versus limestone. And you know, you wouldn't care what you paid for that barley dust. Because it's going, I mean, crab meals like up around 45, $50 for 50 pounds and limestone's what, 10 bucks? Or probably lower if you're buying full bags or something. And so to get up to the same level of chitinase, you might have to like say per cubic foot, which is seven gallons, 120, 112 cups, just to give you a frame of reference. So add two cups of barley, not even 2% to that amount. And you have the same benefit from, I'm just talking about the one enzyme, phytonates, just that one. But you're getting all the other benefits. See, I knew my connection sucked. Every time I talk, I'm interrupting you. Oh, go ahead. That's my fault, though. That's my stupid internet. Somebody had a really interesting question that I also had when I was researching this stuff, you know, a couple of years ago, in terms of like the differences between gypsum and oyster shell. So oyster shell is calcium carbonate, gypsum is calcium sulfate. Yes. And there's a unique. And so if your soil is in need of, right, right. I was just gonna say, if your soil is in need of sulfur and calcium, gypsum is your choice. If your soil is in need of calcium carbonate, then oyster shell is your choice. Would that sound somewhat close to what you would recommend? There's a difference in the form and it's really important. In the calcium carbonate, obviously it's a compound of calcium, carbon and oxygen. And that's a good thing. In the case of gypsum, it's calcium sulfate, but and this is a good thing. It's elemental calcium and sulfur oxide for I believe, don't hold me to that one, but and which is water soluble. So that's a good thing. So as soon as it's hydrated in the soil or soon, the sulfur will break off from the calcium leaving you with elemental calcium. And so that's gonna mean it's gonna be, if calcium is what you want and you do, it's gonna be faster acting. So I would say both. I would do something like, let's say you're gonna add a cup, one cup of calcium, a liming agent for, I would make it half of each, a half a cup of oyster or limestone, it doesn't matter, and a half a cup of the gypsum. I mean, they're both certainly inexpensive enough. And a lot of people... This is a perfect option. Go. Well, you want sulfur because sulfur is really integral to most metabolic functions on this planet, not the least of which is the production of terpenes, terpenoids and ketones. Have you ever heard or read online a complaint by CORE growers that my cannabis doesn't have any flavor or aroma? Right? Pretty common. Yes, I have. Yes. And they don't get the white ash that we get in living soils. and I can't believe I'm saying this, but you can like fix most of the problems with about half a cup of gypsum. And just make sure you buy it in the garden section, not the home repair. There's two forms of gypsum. Is that kind of like you're turning it into buffered core versus unbuffered, which kind of I feel like it wants to compete with the plants for the nutrients and absorb things that it's lacking. Well, I have to be real honest with you, other than some horrible potting soils that I was asked to test that had it in there, they were like proud as a rooster of two peckers. Yeah, we've got core and a peat. Oh, don't use either but let's try this. And we got to day 2425 before I took a machete and take it down. It was too painful to watch. National brand to that should put a lot of confidence. I was gonna start my five worst potting soils that I've tested but maybe I won't. Anyway, so yeah, you can fix a bad core. There's an oxymoron for you. Yeah, with some gypsum. That easy. I think it home depot. So jim when y you can fix the core with because of the sulfur and or is it is it, but it's definitely the sulfur because sulfur, unfortunately in the cannabis world, sulfur means one thing, fungicide. Were you around when they had sulfur burners? Okay, dude, we used to, I'm embarrassed to say it, we used to burn in at the indoor spot like, you know, in 2014-13 we were burning sulfur on flowering plants. Okay right right right um yes in the myth what people don't understand is that sulfur dioxide you know like uh acid rain stuff what I'm talking about is sulfur oxide and I believe it's SO4. I'm pretty sure that right there's components there's two components to the sulfur there's the sulfur and the I guess it's a catalyst or some sort of emulsifier is that what you would call that yeah I just buy a secondary chemical in the compound I'm just I'm so uh what do you call it minimalist. I just get some sulfur and stick it in the back of the garage and you know, add it as such. I don't high dose anything. The only thing I feed my worms is on a regular week, I'd say weekly seven to 10 days is mean kelp and some rock dust. The rock dust acts as a particulate that holds on to fungi that it can anchor onto, not that it's going to deconstruct. It's been around for 400 million years, it's highly unlikely that six weeks in your worm bin is going to do much to the deconstruction of the basalt. And so back to, okay, so let's do cation exchange because that leads into the paramagnetic. Your cations are like calcium. If you were to ask a chemist, what is the symbol for calcium, they would write a uppercase C and a lower case A. Fair enough. If you were to ask a soil biologist, they would do the same thing and they would add two plus signs to indicate that the calcium ion has two additional exchange sites. And in the subsoil world, hydrogen is used as a form of payment. Think of it like a banking system. So this calcium ion can grab and hold on to two hydrogen atoms, right, releasing it to the root, the calcium ion. And that's where it comes into play is that if you were to use, okay, so magnesium, same thing, it might only have one, I think it's one exchange site, but you get the idea, your phosphorus, your magnesium, the macronutrients. So there's a lot of electrical current in this whole thing, because you have positive charged ions and you have negative charged ions and paramagnetism is that the basalt or granite they're the only two in the world that I know of I'm pretty sure I'm right on that or paramagnetic and carry a charge into the soil to keep, there it is, this magnetic, okay, just let's put up the, right, the magnetic field, that's probably a better way to... Is it linear field and rather weak? Is that what you're referencing? The linear structure? Yes. There you go. Right there. Due to unpaired electrons in the material. So it organizes itself in a way that is organized. Right. It brings order because in the soil, let me explain this one. All right. In the literal sense of the word, soil is only has two components. It's well, actually three. No, it's decomposed organic material, which is either animal or plant, right? And the other one was shattered rock and the shattered rock out there through lichen. And it peeled off pieces of rock. Over millions and billions of years, we get the idea that's what soil is everything else is an amendment. So the magnetism was already there because those were the earth was covered pretty much at least in this part of the world with basalt still is. If you go down not so many feet, you have swaths of basalt that will boggle the mine, you know, 600 feet thick. I mean, it's insane. I live on a basalt ledge from an ancient flow. It's certainly a renewable renewable resource. Absolutely. And when you look at the website that I referenced, Remineralize the Earth, you'll see how critical it is in the tests that have been done that adds nutrient density to our fruits and vegetables, which is, you know, the issue is we got to feed a lot of people advances in medicine lead to more humans. And we need better food. This alarm was sounded back 84 years ago in 1936. While this isn't anything new, And we got really bad after World War II. We got a whole bunch of ammonium nitrate. They've done some great work in India. What website did you have pulled up there? Was that what Jim was just talking about? Yeah, that's it right there. Oh, there it is. Yeah. There's one other one I'd like to have you look at. You might want to bookmark it. It's called seaweed.ie for Ireland. Okay, that's Dr. Michael Gary, one of the world's leading experts on marine algae. And if you go on the left, go down to nutrition. So this table here shows you there's three forms of marine algae. There's red, which grows mostly along the shore. There's green, and then brown. Brown's the one that we use in our gardens. The Esco phylum notosome on the left. That's the one we buy when we buy kelp meal. And as you can see, there's some alginic acid, which is one of the most important compounds in this is only found in ground kelp marine algae. It does it's not found in red or green. If for no other reason, that's why you wouldn't want to go down and pick. Well, they do Irish, you ever heard of Irish moss? That's a red kelp. They use it in ice cream as a thickener. I can't remember, collagen or something like that. Okay, so if you go on down, and also, marine algae, brown ke kelp is the only plant on the universe that creates alginic acid. And it's also important because it can hold 250 to 300% of its weight in water. So it helps to maintain a more consistent hydration level in our soil. And the other one that's all mannitol, that's a key lading agent, you'll see that it's only in the first three columns as your least five centuries. Most of the kelp that's produced in North America goes to animals. Race horses, show dogs. If you want a healthy animal, you give it kelp. You want to be healthy, you should eat two teaspoons a day. Just raw kelp. So this is the resources at this website are extraordinary. In terms of videos and where the how it's harvested and everything. This is a very sustainable, the ground kelp that we buy is very sustainable. If there's a because it's controlled by international treaty and backed by the two big hotspots are Norway, which is where maxi crop originated back in 51 and caddy and seed plants in Nova Scotia. It's all hand harvested hand harvested sun dried and then milled to a consistent size it's minimally processed i only have two well somebody in the comments said do you want a combination of those three? But I think you were specifically saying you want brown. The other two, whatever, but you want brown. That's the one. And so you have to be really careful when you buy stuff from eBay. Look at country of origin. And hopefully they'll give you the species. And if it's go and look it up on that website. And you can look up that species and get a coherent analysis of the nutrition levels. I wouldn't use red. I mean, it costs a shitload of money. I mean, I get the bro deal on the kelp, so I'm down around 55 cents. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't know, a dollar, a dollar five. Yeah, a dollar five, a pound. I mean, in the last- That's really killer pricing, dude. Well, last month I sold. 10,000 pounds of kelp to two customers. Commercial operations down south. So. Yes. Do you so you're a vendor for for a producer or no, I just do favors for people I Mean I you know, like all the online suppliers buy from one source Concentrates Their grand for like in the Northwest. I'm not talking about Oregon, I'm talking about the Northwest. They're grandfathered in with the Canadian sea plants because they carry it when nobody else would. So if you're selling it or repacking it in the Northwest, they get a fingerprint. Pretty cool, huh? That's what, you know, loyalty. Before, there was a lot of reason why this is true. There's all kinds of assault here, but not in the form of rock dust. That came later, too long a story. But anyway, there from Gaia green happening. Lichens. Huh? Lichens is how rock turns to dust right? Just to that's just the other story you were gonna. Oh no. You know it's another day's story but. No no when the earth was being created. Okay so now okay here's why we now have the salt rock test. On the Columbia River, which is a major transportation thoroughfare, ocean bound ships coming in getting unloaded, reloading, going back to Asia. So rivers, you want you want to see you have jetties every so it slows down the, so the ship isn't going from left to right. Stability, how's that? Well, not that they wanted to cut them into cubes, but all the rocks had to be of a consistent size and you know, what have you. So they found the mine and when they began mining it, they would have to shave off some pieces or sections to comply with the requirements of the contract. So they brought in these machines from South Africa, the diamond mine thing, and these machines can take the particles, get knocked off and turn it into a retail product or a commercial product. I wouldn't say retail, right? How cool is that? So when they used to sell concentrates one year, their last year, they had no competition. The stuff out of Grand Forks, Canada, Canadian rock dust, which is, I'll leave that one alone. Okay, they sold a quarter million, yeah, a quarter million pounds. That's a lot. But when the local stuff from Cascade Minerals, that's the one you want, because it's Oregon and Washington basalt really hard. It blew everybody away. The results are just, because you're increasing the fungal colonies, if nothing else. But also because the paramagnetism is adding ordered, as that article pointed out, it adds order to the action in the soil. Which is why- This is a perfect opportunity to talk about your soil mix, I think. You're like, literally, I want to run down the ingredients for everyone so that they can like have that, write it down. Okay, so this is by volume. The first thing the main ingredients. You can adjust it. It's not you know, cast in stone. But anyway, I like to use one third sphagnum peat moss. sphagnum peat moss comes in 3.8 foot bales. You can get them at Home Depot, you can get them through Ace Hardware. If they don't carry them at your local, you can do ship this store so you don't pay any shipping and handling. And it should be cheap. If you buy it at a grocery store, you kind of get what you deserve. All right, it's not necessarily spend 50 bucks. It's necessary to spend like 15. And that 3.8 will bulk out to about five and a half to six. We're talking sphagnum, not peat moss. So it has structure, it has strings, it has air passages for water and air to get down into the soil. Really important when you're trying to do, create an aerobic soil. Is that the difference between sphagnum and traditional peat moss is the stringiness, the length of the fiber? Okay you weren't around but back in the 70s you'd say that sphagnum is like the tops and peat is like the shape. When you get a bag of pot, you know, to smoke. Perfect, perfect. And now, and it's and it's alive, it's microbially alive. Because here's the beauty of the 3.8. They're cut when it's frozen, they're wrapped and shipped and they go down and the small amount of water is, you know, allowed to remove. So it's not it's not processed heat it comes in and first of all they run it through a layer at 150 or 60 degrees to what do you call it sterilize it because you don't want bugs in your soil right now it comes. Because you don't want bugs in your soil, right? Now it comes down to a processing plant. Oh, don't want bugs in my soil. No. Now it comes down to a processing plant and nobody, and I mean nobody, I don't care what they say, pack their own soil. As much soil as Miracle-Gro, they don't own a single processing plant in North America. It's all done under contract, mostly by the companies that actually harvest the peat, like Sun Grow. Sun Grow does black gold. I talked to a side note, I talked to a guy, I won't name drop, but he's a huge soil producer. And this was back in 2016, probably. He was doing a conference talk on the good stuff that he sells. And he said at the end of the conference, after all of my other soil is packaged up and I have my tiers of top tier, middle tier, bottom tier soil, I then sweep the shop floor and package that and sell that to Miracle Grow. Yeah. I'll tell you another one. I don't never mind. I won't be buying black gold potting soil anytime soon. I'll leave it at that. You know, it's right up there. It's right up there. That's so funny. I told you I wasn't gonna name drop, Jim. Yeah. Okay. All right. So back to the soil. So we've got I'm just kidding. We got this, we got this sphagnum peat moss. And now we're going to add the same amount of volume of a aeration and I like to use pumice. And there's a lot of reasons because excuse me, yeah, pumice. I don't like perlite because it moves around. Remember the soils that I mix are going to last four or five years. So the last thing I need is a top layer of perlite. So the next wind that comes along, you know, I see my money going down the street. So but perlite, it's it's inert, it's volcanic glass. It does nothing it has no, it's glass. And those little holes is where microbes sequester their feces that can be accessed by roots and in some cases require mycorrhizal fungi. So that's why I like it, it stays where you put it. You get it mixed right, that's where you, you know, that's how you like it. And then the final one is, you know, and that comes from your, that comes from that pomace versus perlite argument, that from your commercial experience with Japanese Lacemakers, right? Correct Right, in fact and those live for years and years and years With a required first of all before you get them to market size you're looking at four four and a half to six years depending on the particular cultivar. Okay, so one of the biggest costs or expenses in the commercial nursery is what we call knockovers. The container gets knocked over by wind. You know, usually that's obviously wind and up here when it rains and the wind. It's not on the go out, say, well think about this, one acre is 36,000 plants in the number one pot. And if you're a big producer and you're selling like a quarter million plants a year, okay, you might have eight or nine, 10 acres in production of container plants and you can't have them bouncing around. So that's where you need the soil stable to the extent, I mean, you're- Stable and you need it to not move around within itself. Correct. Yeah. It's interesting to go, there's a show every year, it's not gonna happen this year with all the things going on, but it was called Far West and it's put on by the Oregon Association of Nurseries. And this is not like your home and garden show where you got massage tables and jacuzzis. This is like producers, machines. I mean, if you saw how mechanized the nursery sector is, it's mind blowing. There's some places back in North Carolina, what's the name of that? Bobby Bonnie, something like that. You'll find them at nurseries, their plants. Human hands never touch it until you grab it off a shelf at Home Depot. The whole thing is robotic. Dude, these machines are crazy. I think Andy Crawford is the guy's name. I hope I'm not mistaking him. He sells these horticulture machines that literally they will repot for you. Oh yeah. And they'll do tens of thousands of plants in a day. Yeah. I mean, I used to laugh at, okay, think about this. This is just Christmas trees. Oregon sells seven and a half million trees a year. Seven and a half million every year. They're all grown from clones. They don't call them that, only stoners call it clones. They're all grown from cuts. Okay, so think about this for a minute. If you're selling 7.5 million a year, you have to create at least 800,000 for die-offs and other issues, right? So that's four or five years from now, you'll have another seven and a half million, right? I mean, can you imagine what it would take to do seven and a half million cuts a year in easy cloners? I mean, what, a 600,000 square foot warehouse somewhere. It's someone that's really funny. Yeah. Yeah. Just because you have a lot of money and buy a lot of neat toys doesn't make you a producer, as we learned up here in 17. Did we lose Aaron? So just one thing, people in the chat had mentioned black soldier fly and one question I have is, you know, we've talked composting, vermicomposting, have you explored kind of, you know, insect frass and... No, but Doug at Northwest Red Worms got heavily involved in it and sells the larva and the reactors or whatever they're called. And I, yeah, it's incredible. It's amazing. And there is some chitin. It's another way to go for sure. And the frass, I've been given some by a commercial company or two. And I ended up adding it to my worm bin because I kind of believe from experience, and I've been working with the same soil mixture, So almost a decade now, you know, a tweak here and there. But I run everything I can through the worm bin, because then everything's chelated, everything's bioavailable. So that when it goes into the soil mix, people go don't you cook your song or what with a bechamel sauce? I don't know, I just fucking mix it and you know, I put a plan in it. I mean,, don't you cook your sauce? I go, what, with a bechamel sauce? I don't know. I just fucking mix it and I put a plan in it. I put all my effort in the worm bin because it pays back in spades. You can go to YouTube and look up Cornell University, which is one of the oldest horticulture schools in the United States. And their research there on vermiculture is an eye-opener. I'll give an example. For several years, it was known that worm castings provided a high level of fungicide protection. That's established. And then five years ago, maybe six, a woman by the name of Yasmin Cardoza was doing her doctorate under the auspices of Dr. Clive Edwards, who holds a degree from Oxford and a degree from Michigan in entomology as it relates to composting worms. She established that the worm castings also provide a high level of pesticide by inhibiting eggs from hatching because of the diversity and that's why diversity in your worm food is integral. Can you grow it from kitchen scraps? Yeah, but it's a dumb way to go. Since most kitchen scraps are 99% water and worms are really magical, but they can't convert water to castings. You need bulk and that comes to you in the form of manure, horse or cow. I think cow is better because maybe it does open in. And then of course, making your compost. And another avenue that I've kind of gotten people around here is there's a place here in Portland that sells what I would call a serviceable compost. Is it great? No. But you can make it great really easily with some kelp, some neem, and some barley and give it about four weeks and now you've got, you know, a nine plus on a scale of one to 10. And going into a grow with that level of diversity and nutrient density, you're ready to rock and roll. Perfect. So that's like a perfect like description of all three things that are the foundation of your soil. You have Canadian, Saginaw, peat moss, one third input on that, one third of an erative input. So pumice is what you recommend. And one third vermicompost. And this is not just kitchen scrap vermicompost, this is black leaf mold. You're paying a lot of attention into what you're putting in, making sure you're not. I think everybody should reach any water based inputs in there. Yeah, I mean, there's a way to work with recycling. I'll get that in just a second. So now we're down to the soil, and we're only going to add three or four materials, one of those Xembe rock dust. Now, a cubic foot is 7.2 gallons or something like close to that. So we can call that 112 cups. So I just want to put that in perspective, how little inputs you're actually adding. So you're going to add a couple cups of salt or granite. Okay, remember now all the castings and then that's why we call it Burma compost. It takes two years to make pure castings. So anybody that tells you they're selling pure castings is running a scam. So that's you have an immense amount of calcium carbonate, right? That's bioavailable right now. So we're going to add to our mix a half a cup of gypsum and a half a cup of some calcium carbonate, oyster shell, limestone, easiest one is probably for most people just go over to Home Depot, grab a 25 pound bag for nothing. Or if you have a feed store, it's probably going to be around 10 bucks or 50 pounds. I mean, somebody asked me once what don't you worry about it going bad? I said, well, it's been around for about 20 million years. I doubt that a couple of years in the back of my shirt. So anyway, so now we have our lining agent. Okay. How do we get there? And then the final one is a cup of kelp, always mandatory. No seaweed extract. You want raw chopped kelp, the kind they sell at a feed store. Stay away from down to earth unless you got a lot of money to burn. Couple probably last year, you know, with a minimum amount of care, probably at least three years. I mean, you know, invest, plan ahead, you know. And then the final one, and I know this one, dry storage is a great thing to have. What's that? You got to have dry storage for nutrients for fertilizer. You know, it's like you got to have bins. Yeah, yeah. And then the final one, and I don't really care about certain unqualified people that call themselves consultants, they should emphasize and put in bold, the con company. And if you have the luxury idea, half a cup of name and a half a cup of Karanja. Now Karanja is interesting because that's actually a legume, even though it's a tree, it's a legume. And what that name in Karanja add is nitrification holding the nitrogen in the soil rather than allowing it to vaporize and float off into the atmosphere. That's kind of a neat concept don't you think? Off-gas, yeah, nitrogen off-gases and leeches so easily that if you can have a nitrogen fixing nodule in your soil, there's nothing better. You can't feed the plant that much night. Yeah, well, that's where I'm not either either and or nitrogen corundra. So if you need a source contact me i've got some of the best sources some of the best name out of india out of mumbai it's really really good and uh we'll take care of you and then what about aloe vera powder? That is another question that I always like to shout people out when they ask a question. I think it was Walter. Let me see. Oh, coconut powder was a question I got from salt Walter. So do you have any experience using coconut powder instead of like the coconut water? No, because I really studied the coconut deal and I'll sum it up real briefly. A coconut is a seed. And so the young coconut, the type that you find in Thai food stalls and what have you, is you can cut it with a knife. And when they pour it out, you get close to 12 ounces of water, right? So that's the embryo of a coconut seed. And as it matures, if you left it intact, the water builds up on the inside of the shell and the shell develops. And now it's a fertile seed. You'll notice that the type we harvest to eat, right? So you notice that when you bust that one up, you might get a couple, what, tablespoon maybe or two? You don't get much water. So we want the water because this is, imagine the benefit in barley, imagine a live seed with the coconut water. It's an amazing thing an a and it's well worth a tri or sometimes hispanic an see they're white and the trimmed kind of in a cone cut with a knife because t yet. That's the real you want to grow good person. Those are delicious. Yes. Yes, they are. By the time it ends up in a can at Costco. I'm not, you know, I like to grow really good weed, you know, and I, I don't buy anything in a grocery store. I buy every thing, food markets and food. That's what I feed my plants is food. Isn't that interesting? Isn't that ironic? You feed your plants food. Yeah. Aloe vera was the first plant that was domesticated by the human race as a medicinal plant and predates the most ancient kingdoms in Egypt. In fact, they used to use the aloe vera to prepare the bodies for mollification. Then it moved to India at some point and became part of the spice trade, which spread plants all over Europe and Africa and what have you. And so when we look at the history of the aloe vera plant, it's one that goes way back into this day, you would be hard pressed to go and get a off the s pharmacy for your skin th salicylic acid. If you w for some kind of a treatme probably pharmaceutical g acid is a common ingredient for acne treatment. Absolutely. All right. And then the acetyl form is aspirin. That's where Bayer made all of its money to be the criminals that they are today. I mean, they made Monsanto look like Girl Scouts, especially in Africa. But every plant produces some amount of salicylic acid. And here's where we're going to get back to the barley. In plants, what we in humans or our pets, we call immune systems. In plants, they use the term pathways. And one of the most important pathway in a plant is the chitinase hyphen salicylic acid pathway. And wrap your brain around that one and you'll see the importance of adding, because no plant produces the amount of salicylic acid that an aloe vera plant. It's almost like scary. You don't need a lot, you're using fresh. And where you live brother, you can grow all the aloe vera plant. It's almost like scary. You don't need a lot of using fresh and where you live brother, you can grow all the aloe vera you want. Try growing it in Oregon in the rainforest. You know plant came out of Egypt for Christ's sake and spent a few centuries in India. Within 200 years. I don't know if you'd be able to see it but I actually have two aloe plants. Where the hell are they? Right outside my window. There's one. Can you see it? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. You should have thriving. You should have one in your kitchen in a pot so that if you burn your hand as you're cooking, you want to cut a piece of the end off and rub it on your burn. And more often than not, you won't even end up with a blister. So this plant cleans and it removes anaerobic materials in and around our roots. It's almost the first time I used it, was cloning like I always every other day or so. So it was in liquid. And I let them grow to 18 inches, these roots. And there was one ground spot on them from this aloe vera. And I said to myself, I'm onto something. This is really big. And I know that salad cellic acid is a big one in tissue culture propagation. So it didn't take me long to like put a and b together and and then I came up with like cheapest this okay this one is like really stupid. So the brand you want to buy in the United States is Lily of the desert. The reason it's called that is that aloe vera is a lily not a cacti. And almost all of it's grown down on the Rio Grande River. All right, so they make products and one of them has to do with the preservative. They make an organic gel aloe vera gel Lily of the desert. So it's you can get a liter, not a liter, a pint, you know, 16 ounces for around eight bucks. And to that, you're going to add, you'll love this one, a tablespoon of a kelp meal and a teaspoon of a fulvic acid from a bio-aggon in Lebanon, Oregon. Shake it up and let it sit outside for about, on the shelf, or kitchen shelf, for about two days, and then put it in the refrigerator. Now you got gel that costs less than $10 and do at least a thousand plants. There's your rooting gel. Another easy one is honey. No, no, no, I'd rather go pay $70 for two ounces of Clonix. Thank you very much. Yeah, Clonix. Yeah, the really bad one out there is in a case of all your all of your green commercial are going to be either SA salicylic acid, IAA endoacetic acid or IBA which is endo three butryx acetyl acid. Okay, so that's the one that you find in dip and grow, which they cater to the nursery, excuse me, Christmas tree industry. So it's been said that you can actually clone a popsicle stick with dip and grow. All right, so the other one is IEA and that's all like your Olivia's and you know, aren't we cute and stuff. But the one you gotta watch out for is NAA, Napa Acetic Acid. It's an artificial compound first created by Monsanto back in the 50s. It's a fucking, it's a fungicide. It is a fungicide. Why would you use a root because it's got a cute label like Johnny B. Stoned or you know, I mean some idiotic growth store, you know, label and picture. It's insane. Now you want to talk about well, you know, somebody said there's a lot of potassium in Kelp. What do you use? What do you use the clone? Clone X? Okay. You want a different not different hero. Do you have a easy cloner on an old one? Laying around? Pour in like I have a knockoff brand. Like an aeroponics type cloner. Yeah, aeroponics. I meant that like saying zero. Yeah. Okay. Use aloe vera in the water. Watch your roots explode. It's also antibacterial and antifungal so you can actually there it is there you go you can actually like um you can actually use it instead of like if you use hydrogen peroxide or chlorine in your water you can use aloe as a preventative. Correct that correct. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Just try some get a good, I don't know liquid or gel, you have to figure that part out. But make sure it's low desert and they have it comes down to the preservative. And so on the organic ones, you get the ones that are not like phosphoric acid, you know, and that silliness, but you know, usually a citric acid is the most common preservative. So there you go. Oh, so back to the soil. So there you go. That's the same. So I feed the same thing to my worms that I'm going to use in my soil mix as far as Neiman kelp and barley and aloe vera. Like you with your fresh, you could use to get the gel out or whatever. And the barley is where you're getting the fungal activity from? Absolutely, absolutely. Because the more we can put a good fungal colony development in our soils of the earliest possible part of the process, right? That's going to carry through for several years. A living soil means that a living cell, not that I was too lazy to go to take care of business. You know, you got to do things that feed the soil. And how do we do that? Well, we add more biology to our soil. I put it up, I'll send it to you. A five year old soil that is off the charts on the macro, a little minor, a little down on the micronutrients. That's what kelp's about. Here's why kelp is so important. The NPK thing is based on the law of minimums. All right. So basically you can make a plant survive. But plants use 83 elements. Why do we know this? Well, that's how many are in kelp, because it's a plant. But more importantly, it's in the right balance. It wasn't some grosser or jack off going, well, need more magnesium on this thing or, oh, I want boron, or whatever the latest gig is. It goes in cycles. So when we add kelp, we're adding a material that has accumulated all 83 elements in the right proportion. That more than anything- The major ones being copper, molybdenum, iron, there's a whole bunch of. Yeah, it is. And the idea that after World War II that we could manipulate agriculture and we could bend the sciences of botany and make a horrible definition of agriculture in this country and how we were producing our food. I guess it doesn't matter if you're gonna turn your grains into pop tarts or, you know, some kind of idiotic chicken pot pie from Swanson or something, you know, and you can see the TV dinners. That was a generation I grew up on. TV dinner is lovely. It's not bad enough to have meat though, but now it's been frozen and made in a plant somewhere in Pig's Knuckle, Arkansas. So it isn't different. And what I try to teach people is this isn't about cannabis. This is about growing plants for your health. You want a real tomato, you better grow it, because you're not to find it in the store. And now that's what we've done to cannabis. I mean, some of the stuff I've seen come out of these dispensaries, I mean, it's appalling. Appalling. Even the worst Colombian, which most of it is bad, you know, from the late 70s is better than this. And that's really saying a lot. You know we missed a question way back. Yeah Jessica are you gonna go to the aloe vera the age one? So just quickly wrapping up that I was gonna St. Bernard's observation booth asked any comments on aloe plants having to reach a certain age before they are really effective? Absolutely not. I received a book from Jeremy Silva at Build A Soil, an anthology of articles by two researchers and it's too in-depth to go through here but these are articles dating all the way back to like the 1810, excuse me, 1910 in that era. World War, unfortunately, wars create opportunities to study things and that's, you know, medically and pharmaceutically. And that's the same thing that had Alvera became a big deal with, as you mentioned, with the dermatologist, anything you get from a prescription or a dermatologist is going to have Uber levels of salicylic acid. Here's another one for you can buy like a kilo of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little I mean, it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, veryonic plan or something. I mean, is that faster rate? So, um, I would, you know, I couldn't even imagine I, I buy them from, uh, I buy that they're called Frans, F R O N D S Frans at the Mexican, uh, supermarkets, supermarkets, because it's widely used in kitchens for burns, and or a sunburn or anything, you know, like say you get a bit by a mosquito, you put aloe vera piece of the gel on your penetration side of the insect, and it draws the poison out. But doesn't same thing in the soil is that, and this is really a bad way to phrase it, I'm gonna beat up on this, but basically it can wash your roots and get rid of decayed material. It cleans house in there. And the big one is the salicylic acid is the big player here. And the amount of data out there, I see a lot of things that I started using and talking about. I had to take a material that was made mainly like aloe vera, used by humans. But then I found some veterinary links. So now I can establish, okay, so there's a medicinal value here that exceeds just because some people drink it as a with ulcers, stomach ulcers. Yeah, I mean, it's it's a wonderful, wonderful plant to have around. And that's why the human races embraced it for almost 5000 years. So I felt pretty comfortable. It was cool that. Aloe cleans or washes the the root space is that yes, is that was that what you said. Yes. It reminded me of something else that you mentioned. Oh, go ahead. No, I'm just expand on that, if you want. Oh, no, just with all the when you have a really active soil, especially like when you use the air pruning pods like smart pod allow a lot of oxygen into our roots. We're going to get more massive root development. And that's where cleanliness, house cleaning, it can be helpful. But the other side of it is, is that in the world of plants, some plants are identified only by a compound or two, and that's really disingenuous, not to mention inaccurate. So in aloe vera, there's some plants though that accumulate the entire range of macro and micronutrients in the world of botany. Kelp is probably the best. Another one is alfalfa. In fact, old timers, like even in my time, I can remember old timers referring to alfalfa as field kill. Was that that good a material? Well, aloe vera is also a bio nutrient accumulator. And when you really start studying, look for the gibberellic acid compounds that are part of the aloe vera. And that will help you get a good feeling or understanding of what's happening when we use it, especially in the rooting process. It's one thing to get something to root and it's an exciting thing. I get it. But it's another one to pull up a cutting. you've got this mass of root development ready to go into this soil that you made and created carefully and always selective about what you used. I'm just looking through the questions right now. The American one asks, go ahead. I was gonna do the one from the American one about. Yeah, okay, yeah. So the American, well, one of the American ones questions, what elements are most detrimental and excess in a soil for plant growth? Are there some to be careful with more than others about overdoing it? Yeah, the big one comes to mind is magnesium. If you look at the molecule of chlorophyll, chlorophyll-2, which is the most common on the planet. There's one magnesium ion. There's four nitrogen ions, and I couldn't even begin to count. I'd have to look it up. But carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, one magnesium. Where the myths started about these magnesium hungry plants. I mean, what does their chlorophyll need two magnesium ions? So magnesium, like when you were a child or maybe your own children, when they would get upset stomach and diarrhea or something, you might give them milk or magnesia. And that would solidify the digestive system and stop the diarrhea, right? Well, there's the same thing in the soil. It tightens up the soil and restricts air and water flow. So why it became this cannabis thing, you don't get, I mean, you do, I mean, legitimate soil test and it's almost never a magnesium deficiency, but that's like the instant cure for everything is Epsom salts, Epsom salts, you know, calcium, whatever it is, magnesium sulfate. The most benefit is coming from that is the sulfur. So that's the main one for me is magnesium. That's why I don't use dolomite lime. I don't even understand what CalMag means. I haven't ever had anybody- It's very interesting when you look at it, you were just talking about the magnesium in the chlorophyll and it was very interesting to me when I was doing research on RSO trying to remove chlorophyll from the extract in a post office process. I was researching the chemical structure of chlorophyll and it looks like a key, like a hole with a line and magnesium sits right in the keyhole. There it is. That's not much magnesium. Now, if you look up a red blood cell, what you would find is it's scary, science fiction scary how close it is to chlorophyll, but we have iron. So iron is the anchor in a red blood cell, so you know, iron pore blood and all this bullshit. But now we have magnesium hungry plants which I've never been able to get any botanist or even somebody online what is this cow mag thing? Oh well you know I use it because you know we're off to wishing and hoping. So yeah the other that one's the worst in my opinion. We cannabis people, they're that phosphorus, you know, the american one specific because he's worried that plus the gy Langmanite plus the gypsum is going to be too much sulfur. In my experience, it's hard to hit two sulfur toxicity, but that said, you do want to monitor with some sort of, if nothing else, arbitrary understanding of what your inputs are, but at best soil tests. I mean, I wouldn't use both. The one I would probably not use is the Langley and I and go with the sulfur but I'm really setting my ways probably old age or senility or something but I really like I'm, I go back to basics. I'm gonna use basalt and I'm not gonna use zeolite or calcinated bentonite. I mean, a lot of this stuff is just what they call a label building in the gross store world. The more crap you can get on the label, it sounds like you really know what you're doing. And so KootzMix couldn't do any good because there's nothing there. That's funny. Yeah, right. Well, really what they do is they take things that are working in nature and break them down to their constituent components and try and upsell these individual components. Sure. Well, I would say couple that with the American mentality that if something's good, more must be better. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I'll leave that one alone. This isn't rocket science. To set up a large, let's say, okay, throw a number at me. Let's say a person is 100 plants commercial. That's a question, not a comment or. Yes. Low-end commercial. Sure, depending on. Or big plants it would be, yeah. Okay. And so what amount of gallon size, what size of pots would you think a typical hundred plant grower would use? It depends on who you're talking about, but I mean, they should probably in today's modern day, they're probably using 10 or 20 gallon fabric pots, high turnover, small plants. Oh, geez. Okay. I'm used to guys, you've seen pictures on my feed, you know, 800 gallon smart pots and they're pulling 10 and a half pounds. You know, that's okay. So let's, all right, let me do it my way way then so let's say we have a hundred gallon pots no 50 50 gallon pots and a hundred of them so that's what five thousand gallons yep okay so if a third of that is worm castings, what would that be? 1,700. A lot. Just make it 2,000. Okay, so 2,000 gallons and divided by seven, because that's how many, I can't do the 7.25. I divide by seven. 285. Okay, so that's. So you got 200 cubic feet. And divide that by 27. What are we talking 10 yards? 10 yards. That's a nothing. Okay, just to put, just to give you a visual. Yeah. When you go into a Home Depot and you go to the garden section, they have the pallets of soil. That's two yards. Okay, so think of that. And we said, how many yards, 10? You get the idea. So that's why they call them two yard totes. So that's a pallet, a full pallet is two yards. So we're not talking a lot of material and to set up to make material and to se I mean you could do that on a city lot. What 50 by 100 on a su day long. l just it's not difficult a what's the most importan compost called patients. don't need you to look at alone. You know, they got it down. They got this down. They don't sleep. They live for almost five years. They reproduce twice a some time ago about gypsum not supporting microbiology. What do you know about that? Nothing. I mean, I've never heard that. I've never heard research that supports it. No. Look, I'm not saying I have a perfect soil mix. What I can say is that every person has ever used it and didn't try to, it would go to, you know, grow the worm factory or something yeah actually made an effort to get some real or even good compost i'll tell you a little secret i watched a very intensive it was translated from uh mandarin chinese to english a documentary on growing tea in China at the original area where the first tea was first produced for the emperor. And do you know what they feed their tea plants? A handful of worm casting once a year. They put it around at the base, like you have two handfuls, you know, and then you put it around the base and tamp it down and that's it if you were to watch it for a king huh fit for a king huh that yeah that's easy that's all i promise you that if you watch at least 10 videos at youtube with cornell university Verma Compost in the title. You'll know more than 90% of the people you're going to meet. You notice I'm very careful about using the word casting, so it says Verma Compost. Okay. You got to start with good compost because you're not going to turn all of it. You want about a 70 30 split. There's a lot of reasons for that it has to do with diversity of the microbes. It has to do with development of fungal colonies. And we can accelerate that with barley. That's what we found exciting. Back to Doug. Okay, so Doug gets his call, calls me at seven in the morning, says I got all this barley. So I go over here and look at it and he's got you know 20 pallets it 55 bags on a pallet right a lot of barley and So he said can I use this and I said yes, just do me one favor is he grows in what they call windrows right there like 60 I guess. I said, give me one windrow and don't amend it in any other way other than using the barley. And I said, and put it on thick. So he did. A couple of months later, he called me and said, I've been doing this 40 years. I've never seen material get flipped. And the amount of worms that I'm getting, I've never seen this. See, I mean, it was massive. Like you'd take a pitchfork and lift it up. It looked like something out of a science fiction movie. This was like, oh, there's one over here. Here's a cool. Yeah, that's incredible. I mean, so it's really cool. I been a fan of yours for a very long time, but I have just started to to kind of like open the book of science that you've created on all of this stuff. And I've created my own organic soil over the last five or six years and it's killer. It works wonders in my garden and my plants love it. But this next cycle, I'm actually using the barley and corn sprouts milled as a top dress only. It's the only thing I'm gonna use. I'm gonna amend first and then I'm gonna do weekly top dresses. So this will be kind of a standalone examination of how the barley and corn sprout influence not the worm bin but specifically my my soil bed. I haven't been there since the gnarly barley product was released but I would imagine there's some pretty glowing reports from the early users. There are. I've definitely lagged on sending them to you. I meant to, but there's people love this stuff, man. And they're chomping at the bit to get more. And there's, you know, Jeremy doesn't have enough, I think. Yeah, I don't get involved in that. What I can tell you is that first time that I tried it. Now, remember, I have a luxury that most people don't. I have a strain that I've been growing for 36 years. And I wasn't always an organic terrorist. I was a gross-stare asshole. I mean, I actually used to buy Fox Farm Ocean Forest because I thought it was good. And then I sobered up and some other things happened. But what I found is that to grow this strain correctly, a minimum of 12 weeks, and I've gone as much as 18, just to see, but 12 is the usual one. And we were able to reduce that by 20% down to nine and a half weeks. And I don't care what you're growing, if you're a farmer of whatever it is, and you can whack up 25% of your time required in the field, that's pretty amazing. And as it relates to cannabis, it did not diminish the potency, a yield. So you got for just using barley, you got 20% off your flour time. Pretty cool, huh? That's incredible, man. I mean, I've had rounds where I've had flour finish in six weeks that usually takes seven or eight. And I didn't know why. I just, oh, I just got lucky that round. But I think there are certain inputs that I used that I didn't even understand that I was creating this growth hormone regulation system in the soil that allowed the plant to move much quicker. Well, I don't wanna bother you, but I'll be more than happy to send some of my PDFs that I've collected over 15 years in the realm of biology or botany in general and soil biology. And then the mall man, that stuff bothers me, especially as it relates to barley because when I hit that one, I cannabis, I'm talking abo That's the biggest issue the human race is food an little garden. the biggest fruit set. And I feel it's what do you put on there? Caught me out and barter. No, no, really. What do you spray with some meanwhile, once in a while? You know, I'm like, you know, I'm not I'm not that I couldn't be a production manager at one of these cannabis factories. You didn't see me on film at 11, you know, man goes berserk and shoots his coworkers or something. I mean, I would go out to these things and just look at them. I remember one guy, he was big shot. You know, tell me, yeah, we got, we're well funded. We've got at least two and a half million dollars in reserve looking right now i said good deal because you're going to need it and they never they never did get a crop out of the ground never did oh yeah it was a joke tell you what there's a i'm uh you know oklahoma's got a prospering cannabis economy right now and I'm setting up out there and my contractor's working on some indoor grow out there and he's telling me he just had to set up this facility where the guy didn't even have a well drilled yet and he had plants. He had 500 plants and no well. And I mean, these people have no idea what they're doing. It's unbelievable. Well, think about this. We're not the biggest in the country, but Oregon does about $1.7 billion a year in nursery plants. The kind included in mostly like you find outside of Home Depot or Lowe's or, you know, the bulk stuff, arborvitas, you know, yeah, whatever. So there's a lot of production here. If you were going to set up a cannabis farm, do you think it might have been helpful if you would have sought out people that had, oh, I don't know, 12, 15 years experience and run in a nursery instead of the guy that was the manager over at indoor garden center? I mean, it was a joke. That's a problem, man. Yeah, you can count the brain cells on one hand. Yeah. I just walked, I stayed away. I told one, well, he, this room, this, no, it wasn't a room, it was a greenhouse. It looked like a room because it was mold on the ceiling, the walls, the pots, everything. And he said, what do you think we should do? And I said, I would go to an Army surplus store and buy 10 machetes and get your crew and chop this thing down and then have it completely sanitized by a professional company. Because you're just going to, anyway, they didn't. And so they had two more cycles like that. And then I put them on, go to email, not go to voicemail automatically. I didn't want to even answer the phone or something. You know, you can't fix stupid. Yeah, you can't. I came out of the nursery sector. I had to make money. I did. You know, I mean, on this plan, I had to take care of it. Because you were paid by the amount of root mass. These are commercial like for architectural landscapers that you know, for resorts, hotels, that kind of stuff. So that plant better be perfect. And when they cut that pot off, that's why they're made of that type of material. They look at the roots and that's kind of like your paycheck for your five years that it sat on your property. So you got to do it right. You know, it's just an volume. We'll make it up in volume. How many people out there paying wholesale $5,000 for a lace maple, you know, that kind of stuff. So back to some dimwit got on a podcast and said you shouldn't use it because it doesn't have any oxen. Well, I'll leave that one. I'm not going to embarrass him anymore. These are embarrassed himself. Come on, give it to us. Give it to us. Well, if you don't count what 13 different growth hormones, that's not, you know, I bet she doesn't know the difference between an oxygen and a hormone. I bet you that all oxen are hormones, but not But not all hormones are oxen and it has to do with It's kind of like that difference between a turkey so options Oxen that are neat. I recently did a little bit of research they when they're in complementary levels they prevent axillary bud growth, which is something I was calling epiphylious bud growth. Remember when I texted you about that? It's axillary, it's actually, so it's a growth that happens when there's not enough of this of this oxen in the in the plant right what should we go back to the vermicompost the better job we do in putting together this we'll call it substrate betty whatever term you want to use the better job we do then the end result is going to be that much better. If I add a small amount, like say, we'll take like maybe for your personal vegetable garden, say you got a 30 gallon pot. So we all know what size that means. And I would add say a couple of weeks of ke And so that when I apply that from a compost to my newly planted starts that I got, or grew whatever, they're off to a roaring start. And the faster you can get that root system developed, that stronger plants you're going to have. That's why I don't like easy cloners. Because at the end of the day, once it roots and you have a lot of roots, that's pretty cool. And I go to plant them, I'm going to lose some energy on it. For several days. Major man, there is a a major slowdown I've even heard it called water roots versus soil roots and I don't think that that's an accurate technical term, but I think what they mean is roots without Denge rights, there's no like sub colony of roots coming out from a main, it'll be a main root and then nothing on the sides. So let me make my case for Grodan Rockwell Cubes. I'll repeat that, Grodan Rockwell Cubes. Are you plugging a big company right now? I am because of your history. They invented for this discussion hydroponic growing in Holland as we know it today. The reason that Rockwell cubes perform like they do is they're made from basalt. And it's heated up to 32 or 3300 Fahrenheit. And like you've seen cotton candy when you're a kid, you went to the fair or something. Well, when you heat basalt up like that, it comes off in strands. And those strands are collected and then formed into the products that you and I have used and seen and used. So that means that this is the salt, nothing else. It's been sterilized beyond, you know, I mean, 3200 Fahrenheit, that's really hot. And it also has the perfect balance of water to air. So that's why it's so important in rooting is that you have that perfect balance. And those roots are gonna develop all up and down the shaft from the top of the cube to the bottom. We've seen that. You let them go a few more days and now you got roots coming out of the sides, right? So that when we put that into the soil and gently pack our soil mix around it, it still has that integrity that was developed inside that rockwool field. So there's my speech. Now one person online said, well, I don't like them because they you know, they don't break down. Right. It's basalt. You know, it's been around for a couple hundred million years. What did you want it to do? It's literal rock strand. Yeah. Why wouldn't that be a benefit? Because we are talking in an aerobic environment, right? Because it doesn't look pretty. We won't get on Cannabis World magazine this month. I mean, I don't know. All the things I worry about that. I've seen pictures of roadside garbage dumps of like old grows where they just literally dump like 20 or 50, you know, cubes of Grodan on the side. And I think for that, it has this bad sort of connotation. People assume that it's not a renewable resource because people throw it away and don't reuse it, but it is rock at the end of the day, rock strand. I think between the three of us, each of us has gone on a pee break. So Jim will be back with us shortly. Yeah. But now I'm loving the conversation. I think we have like, or last I checked, there were like 270 people watching. So I appreciated everyone. Seek One said, what is the best nitrogen and best amount to use in flowering stage for female cannabis for peat and perlite? I think this is sort of a complex question, but the best nitrogen depends on what you're doing. It's complex for me because I don't do the NPK shuffle. I make good Burma compost. I mix it with this and I grow plants that produce really really strong. We cannabis whatever you want to call it. And so, yeah, I'm the old school that if it works, I don't wanna fix it. I didn't wanna cross it with the Kush. I didn't wanna cross it with, oh no, I got this one from Dangoon Han. Oh, really? Good. Have at it. Maybe you can find the guy that's got the magical Acapulco gold that never existed. Yeah. But you, you can only think like that, Jim, because you actually are so highly aware of, of the inputs that you can sort of like, keep it in the back of your mind and know, okay, I have enough cow manure in my compost to have good nitrogen levels later down the road. I think other people just look at it in this really basic, you know, single dimensional kind of way where it's like, I need nitrogen input, I need phosphorus input, I need potassium input, and I need calcium input. So they're looking for one individual thing for each of those. And that's not necessarily the case. It is for sulfur for you, but it's not for nitrogen and phosphorus and for so many other complex macronutrients. Well, that's why, okay, that's to answer your question directly then, is that both Mean Meal and Kelp Meal are bioneutrient accumulators. So that's before we even get into a discussion about compounds that are present, hydrocarbons and what have you, right? Okay, so the kelp meal gives me their correct balance of macro and micronutrients. In my mind, that discussion or concern is over. Then when I add the knee, I'm reinforcing that. Plus like we already discussed, nitrification and what have you. Okay. So, here's what I learned over almost 44 years now growing wheat. The less concerned I was about it, the better, the more science I put into it, the better it was and not what I like to call stoner science. I know when you cut the plant down, man, you wanna stick it in boiling water because it pushes the THC out of the stock into the leaves. You have terpenes in a stock? Wow. Where did this come from? Some far away Tibetan... Bro science, man. See, you must have missed the memo. There was a whole book put out where we all learned this fake information from the internet and we all grew like that for 10 years and then some people made a fucking career consulting people based on that information and that's what they do for a job now. Hey, yeah, I would, nevermind. I can't, don't say this a lot of pride. I attended one of Danny Danko's abortions up in Seattle, the High Times Cup, where of course Kyle Cushman won, you know, it's my stream. No, it isn't. But anyway, I went to the first I went to the first you get can't. I went to the first. You get that. Hold on. Hold on. **** you just called the High Times cannabis company. Oh, it is. It was a joke. Explain this to me. How does the guy? I lost. Who's the how's the how is the guy who's the guy who's the editor? Okay, quits one day. Name of Kyle Cushman. I like to see the birth certificate on that one. How does he start winning cups everywhere? High time cups? Huh? And then he comes out his own product line. Veganics. So a friend of mine, yeah, and then he comes out with his own product line, Vaganics. So a friend of mine- Vaganim Matrix. Oh, Vaganim Matrix, yeah, yeah. And I busted him, not him, he had a stalking horse that would go around on the, and this is back in the forum days for social media, as we call them. Well, I'm really good at research and stuff. I found a factory where it was packed in China, on which ship it came over, on the last where they received it. And then- You're talking about his product? Yeah. Was made in China. Oh, yeah. Wow. When I appeared, one time, one of the first times I appeared on a deal like this was with Adam Dunn. And really nice show. But here was the lineup. See if you didn't think this was cute. We had Kyle Cushman. We had the Rev with his layers and spikes. You know, book. Sounded like a weird name for a bar somewhere. And then me. So I defaulted and said, I'll go after the other two gentlemen. So they nailed Kyle on, is your stuff organic? Almost, it's 95% organic. And I kept thinking, is that like being almost pregnant? Or, you know, what do you mean almost organic? It is or it isn't, right? Or shoes and hand grenades is what my mom used to say. Yeah. And so they, Adam, I think it was nailed him on who actually owned that string with strawberry copper. I don't know some selling this. I think it's strawberry cough. Yeah. Anyway, so they nailed him on that. He didn't actually create it. He didn't actually create it. He sourced it and got famous for growing it though. Well, that's what Adam Dunn was calling him on. That's what Adam Dunn was calling him on. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And I didn't know anything about it because I don't, between you and, I couldn't care less. Um, I already knew the story in 86 when Sam, the skunk man and his skunk number one took first place and how that deal came down. So, uh, yeah. David Watson looked that one up sometime. David Watson and skunk number one. Have fun. Can you give us the cliff notes version of it? Oh yeah, just look up David Watson and skunk number one. The international pharmaceutical that he works for just you know goes on and on like, never mind I'll leave that one alone. I don't think, I think Jim wants to bite his tongue on that a little. I know he does. I'm trying to tease it out of him. No, what's funny is that this happened on IC Mag where he was the assistant moderator. I should state up front that I've been bounced off at every cannabis board that there was and is. There aren't many ises. In fact, one is Grass City, the guy who's the head moderator of the Grand Pupa, he and I are personal friends in real life. So he called me one time, he goes, don't you have other playgrounds? He said, you know how much crap I take from your destruction? So anyway, anyway, Sam's company, he asked a question. So, you know, who knows the origin of the sea of greed? So I piped up, I said, well, actually it was established in China about 5,000 years ago where they would plant close on center what we now call biointensive gardening today, John Jevons at the ecology center. I said some stoner read about it in the late 80s and all of a sudden you guys invented it and called it the sea of green. And I said, as far as the other one silliness the Scrugg, I watched my grandmother put up nets and grow green beans, you know, 65 years ago. So I'm not sure why you're strutting around like you guys really contributed something. You just took things that existed and renamed it, rebadged it. And you know, it's like, Daddy walking out the we were sure we need to name this series. Who shits on idiots? I know it's like the TMZ. This is where we're going cannabis industry TMZ. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, very, very insider stuff. Yeah. I mean, I'll give you an example. There's a product that was $1,000 a gallon, I guess it's now down to 700, you know, whatever. And the city of Portland, when it was plotted back in 1910, the people that were involved, common term I really hated, the Sioux fathers, made sure that there were parks everywhere. I mean, if you look at a map of Portland, it's like green spots everywhere, and they're real parks, not just a slide and some swing set, you know. And the crown jewel is this rose garden, goes back to 1918. That's why we're called the city of roses. That's why they have the rose roses are a big deal here because it's one of those flowers you can grow in a cooler climate. And it's a big deal. This and this garden has like 800 plants, 800 rose plants. So this jack off, a solo consultant, you know, he attended all the conventions and everything. So he's out there and they're trying to get rid of an insect. This way, Google, you know, make Google your friend, right? There's in a soil, breeds in the soil, and then climbs up the stock to do its damage. So don't you think that'd be a really good idea to apply something to the soil to eradicate it from the beginning, instead of trying to shoot it off the leaves with whatever some kind of horticulture oil or whatever? That's my thinking anyway. So I got called in, like, can fix this? Because we're going to have trouble selling this to the city for, you know, a thousand dollars a gallon. I said, well, I promise you it ain't going to happen, but you know, hope Springs eternal. So I went up to look at it and I looked at the situation and it was on a specific plot at the garden. So I excused myself and drove down from the garden to the home brew store Steinbart's and bought two and a half gallons of barley and had them what I call shatter. As you work with brew stores, there's different ways. You don't want it like a flower. You want to, what I call it, it looks like you took a hammer and smashed it. I think it's listed as 0.04 on the mill. There's two mills when I went. It said 0.032 and 0.04. 0 zero four is the shatter point zero three two is the crushed or whatever. So I went back up there. I just put my hand in the bag. And, you know, distributed with my hand. I didn't have any equipment or anything. And later, when they did analysis of the soil, the guy who'd been in charge of the garden for 42 years, imagine that, the head of this one like huge park, obviously 800 plants, and it overlooks Portland. We stand there, you can see the whole skyline of Portland, beautiful spot, a lot of weddings, that kind of place, you know. And the guy was blown away when they got the soil results back. He said your plot mean when they gave me just exploded with new growth. And it cured the insect problem because you didn't even spray it. And I said no, the cure was in the barley because of the chitinase. And that's where the insects live and breathe. So I thought it was probably a good idea to attack it there instead of going out there and every day at five o'clock and shooting millers in horticultural oil or something. Anyway, just to show you the power that especially when you're growing new seedlings because they're unique to cutting in one sense you really want to make sure that you have some small amount of barley in the soil mix because remember we're back to a cubic foot a cubic foot's 112 gallons for this discussion and I only advocate adding two cups so it's not even 2%. This isn't a huge amount, though I do have a friend that that one picture that you saw the 10 and a half pound plant. I was down there that year and he asked me if I could pick up some barley for him. So I said sure. So I said how many bags many bags do you need? He says, well, as many as you can load in your car. I said, oh, whatever. So I get down there and he takes me out and shows me this plant and I said, how much barley are you putting on this thing? He says, oh, 10 pounds a week. So we kind of decided that there is no toxic. I mean, 10 pounds is that's like a lot. Dude, one of these days I'm gonna sprout some barley, put it in a 10 gallon fabric pot and grow a plant in it and and I'll get back to you. I Yeah, I mean, okay, so here's how I discovered it that day that I looked up diastatic malt. In bread baking, you use yeast, right? Either a commercial yeast or a wild yeast. And yeast is a fungi. So they would add malt, barley malt specifically to the formula. And it would it enhances because I also I'm an artisan baker. So it also enhances the quality of the bread and the rise in the spring and all that stuff. So it looks like the bread you buy at a legitimate bread shop, bakery. And so I just figured out, I said, well, if there's fungi in the dough and it really enhances it, then why wouldn't it enhance the fungi in a soil? Just like it does in a red doe. And that's how I figured it out. Not exactly a little scientific, but- Pretty simple stream of logic, but I don't think people think for themselves in this fertilizer realm. They just tend to like, they're so afraid to mess stuff up that they just try to find some pre-programmed. Yeah, and the myth is that if you don't follow this clown's protocol at the Canicon, I love that name, Canicon, know you're an asshole. It's like I remember the days when if you didn't use Ocean Forest and Tiger Bloom and all their bullshit you know you you just I'm gonna have you know bank bank itty bank. Well I'll risk it. Okay I'll throw caution to the wind. I got a bulldog that's pissed off. Dude, I keep having to mute because my dog is sitting over here, tapping around, whining his ass off. We might have to call it due to dog days here soon. Just a minute, my wife came in, she's gonna take her out. So actually, last night with Josh Rutherford and Nick Risdon, Nick had sent a puppy of one of his dogs to Josh. So we're doing this and the dogs could hear and bark back and forth at each other over Zoom. It was sort of trippy. It was like the mom barking and her puppy recognizing the bark and then like barking back. This knucklehead was a gift. Somebody that I knew, I don't, you don't know anybody, but somebody I posted with over at the old IC mag, and that was like the epicenter. Just in the organic soil section, they used to get 2,400 posts a day in threads and stuff. And so I was a big participant over there and I'd help some guys save some serious money on sourcing in Oregon. I said, you're paying how much? Oh, here, I'll tell you where to go. So, uh, fast forward, like a couple of years, I first day I was ever at IG guy had a video of a bulldogs letter. They were running around in their, uh, set up, you know, and, uh, I, I wrote something like, like, that's too cute or something like that. The guy answered back, he goes, if you want one, it's yours for all the help you gave me. So I knew there was a message, so I sent the guy, I go, who are you? He goes, Oh, I was so and so over on IC mag. So he remembered like years later. They've started using a recipe that was pretty much, you know, what I would do. And they had really, really good results. So I've been continuing it for another eight years. See, that's the thing I'm moving into now is using mycology, mycelium to deconstruct the so called used soil. And the way we do that is we cover the top of the, after you've harvested your plant, leave everything intact and you can cover that with a cleaned straw. That's a little more technical than it needs to be. You want to have a good straw and a lot of ways of getting it. And then you're going to inoculate it with the spent blocks, what do you call it? An agricultural waste product, how they grow mushrooms commercially. And so you lay pieces of that on top of the straw It inoculates the straw the mycelium moves on down into the soil and it's going to deconstruct all the roots in the stock Releasing all those nutrients that were accumulated while the plant was alive. So there's no need to throw it out and Start over like you don't need. I love that term, fresh soil. I live where we have ancient forests that predate the human race. I'm not sure what advantage there would be to call in the Corps of Engineers and rip everything out and replace it with fresh soil, whatever that might mean. So it's I mean, think about that. Say you had a big farm with 200 plants and you had a hundred gallon pots, we'll say, and you could get that ready in a matter of a few weeks with just some waste that you get from a commercial mushroom grower. Just completely release everything back and turn it into better than, far better than it was before. If you play your cards, especially like you're in LA, I mean, there must be, don't even think I'm exaggerating, at least probably 30 producers of mushrooms. You know, like the oysters. Yeah, no, and I meet a lot of them at the farmer's markets and I'm like, I want to hang out. That's exactly where I met my mushroom cultivator was at a farmer's market and she has, every Monday she puts out and adds to this pile of spent fruiting blocks. One Monday five years ago I pulled my truck up to that thing and loaded like a yard and a half in there and I'm meaning to do it again but yeah it's Well, I've been growing, the way I got into it was to treat lifelong problems with depression, microdosing. And so I, you know, I've been doing mushrooms off and on, very more off than on, believe me, for 52 years. And most of them have been very horrible experiences. They're not dried, they're slimy. Like Jesus Christ, man, you got a clue. So I decided to grab the bull by the horns and set up to grow any kind of mushroom now at Lion's Mane oysters. Yeah, just some not a lot of success yet but getting there with the Japanese culinary mushroom. Oh, shiitake and maitake.. Shiitake is another good medicinal mushroom. And then of course there's, you know. So just a quick shout out to Mick, who I hope is still watching. He was watching earlier, but is the best mushroom grower I know. What's that? Shout out to... There's a guy named Mick who's watching who's an amazing mushroom grower. I just wanted to say hi to him. Carry on with the conversation. Oh cool. Yeah, the power of the microdosing can't be overstated and having spent a lifetime of the usual prescriptions, the SSRIs or whatever you call them, they don't work. That's just the sad reality for every person that said, well, I know somebody. Yeah, and I probably could name a hundred people that, you know, including family member. So my daughter. So, and it's something we can do. I mean, I just finished a tub as it's called, a mono tub. And at the amount that I do, which is only a gram a week, I've got enough for two years supply and the proper care and you dried them correctly. They're, you know, they have a really long shelf life. So if people are having issues with bipolar, I can't advocate that. But if we're talking anxiety, especially addictions, including alcohol and cigarettes, you know, look at the science behind microdosing. It's a big issue here because we're going to vote on it this November that will allow legitimate research. We'll be the first state to do so. Oh, in the entire state, not just in a like I know like Oakland. Right. Right. Yeah. This is something this will be statewide. And we've had a lot of input and help from all standards up at fungi.com and Olympia. And the heavies have come out to help nationwide, Fehrman and other authors from the late 50s, early 60s stuff at Harvard. And it's pretty exciting that this could happen. It's not gonna be legalization, it's not decriminalization, it's strictly authorized research. Because when Nixon put it on the, what do you guys call it? Schedule one, no medicinal value. So that really, that stopped research right then and there 50 years ago. So that stopped everything. And because there'd been a lot of research in the 60s at major universities like Harvard and Yale and Berkeley and what have you in the 60s with psychedelics in general and psilocybin especially. If you don't know the story of psilocybin, it's pretty exciting. There was a man, I can't remember the name, but you'll find it easy enough, and he was a Wall Street vice president for JP Morgan, I believe it was. And on some excursion in Mexico near Oaxaca, he discovered this shaman and the story of the magic mushrooms. And so he tried them, came back and went down a couple more times in the next three or four years. And then in 58, he wrote an article that appeared in Life Magazine, which was a big deal then. That would be like, I don't know, some really huge national publication today. And he described his experiences. And it came to pass that some spores were smuggled into a French lab, where none other than Dr. Hoffman, Albert Hoffman was assigned the task by his employer, which was the pharmaceutical company where he had invented or created LSD. So here it was 15 years later, and he's in France, and he's the one that gave the two compounds the name, psilocybin and psilocin. The same guy, I just find that remarkable. So we can thank him for both really important misused perhaps, but that has nothing to do with Dr. Hoffman. In fact,, his book, I really advocate it, is titled LSD, My Problem Child. And well worth the read because all the players are in there, you know, the pranksters and, you know, all the people from that era, from the 66 psychedelic explosion. Because remember up until 63 November it was still legal. You could order a kilo direct from Sandoz Labs in Switzerland. Congress didn't make it illegal here until 63. yeah, 63. You gotta love it. I was just a kid, but I just knew that you, because you'd hear reports about Berkeley, this radical school up north near, you know, Oakland. And it's always been a radical school. And that was the free speech movement. And people were doing this radical drug and people were dancing in the Golden State Park and society was freaking out, man. They didn't quite know what to do at this crowd. Yeah, cool times. For me, LSD changed my life. I mean, you know, and it wasn't microdosing for me. It was just these really in-depth therapeutic experiences that really helped me understand myself. Yeah, okay, I read and later actually did, but in Huxley's Doors of Perception and the story on that is that he was going to take and did take peyote mescaline, which is a different alkaloid and he had his assistants with him and they would repeat the questions that he had written down before he ingested the material, right? And so he had wrote the questions and then I don't, later in the episode, they were able to ask questions of their own. What they wanted to answer. So that's the, what do you call it? That's the setting for the book Doors of Perception. And you gotta remember Huxley wasn't affiliated with them, but was a close associate of many of the beats at Kerouac and those guys, the ones that really revolutionized the 50s scene, the beat mix, the forerunners of the hippies in the 60s. And here's actually this intellectual like you wouldn't believe. I mean, you look at his track record academically in England, and it's like he graduated from Harvard and Yale and then did another doctorate at Berkeley just for shits and grins kind of thing. And so this book opened my eyes to like the other side of psychedelics. There was the recreational side such as it was, but then there was also the spiritual side. And he had dabbled in Buddhism, Huxley had, and so he has some questions that in, especially Zen Buddhism, he used what they call Koans, you know, what this and this, then why kind of, you know, questions. Okay, the one that in the book is the famous one, wherein lies the Dharma body of the Buddha. And that's, it goes back centuries in Zen Buddhism. So he that's why he asked the question, because he was familiar with the question, or had put it down for his associates to bring it up right and I know this sounds kind of corny but with great clarity he realized that the tiniest plant at the bottom of the garden is where you'll find the Buddha in other words you'll find the Buddha in wherever you to. I know it sounds like, yeah, it's kind of esoteric, but that's like a big moment in Zen Buddhist life is to come to that. Not the only understanding, but it's an important one. Is that like an examination of the fractal nature of everything top to bottom being the same? Or is that just simply like a religious? No, no, this is as far as the American definition of religion now, Zen Buddhist is more about clarity and in fact, self-realization like Paramahansa Yogananda, his organization, the Self-Realization Fellowship, probably one of the first ones in America dating back to like the 1920s, early 1920s. He set up ash's in several areas. Well, down in Southern California. Yeah, I mean, you ever heard of Swami's? What, Swami the person? No, the surfing spot. Oh, no. Oh, okay. Well, anyway, it's in North San Diego County and Yogananda's ashram was built there by a devotee financier guy and so the surfer is it's a really hot surfing spot and So the surfer is ready back in the 60s gave it the name Swami the Swami's so that's what that connection is so anyway, that's a really beautiful ashram and there's the one in Fullerton and one in Hollywood and one in Pacific Palisades. So I'm in the Bay Area. So. But those books were really important. Yeah, there you go. Now, I was going to to say not this Swami. Yeah. Right. Right. That's what I was thinking. And when you're like, do you know Swami? I was like, I know Swami. Yeah. It looks like one of my plans. I wish I should have sent them to you, but, uh, I'm not sure if I should have sent them to you, but, uh, I'm not sure if I should have sent them to you but uh yeah Aaron's seen pictures of it. I mean the comment I got from a so-called expert was, but looks like it'd take a lot of work to trim that out. Yeah that's kind of the point there, what you don't grow. Yeah I hope you got a lot to trim. Yeah isn't that kind of the point. Well, you don't grow. Yeah, I hope you got a lot of trim. Yeah. Isn't that kind of the idea to go to that? Yes, seriously. Look at this tiny plant that I grew, I hardly have to trim anything yet. You also have an eighth of weed to smoke. Yeah, it's like, you know, it's even goofier up here in Oregon. What's changed now, but at the time when it was legal, or excuse me, was just medical, like, say 2000 or whatever. If you had a card, a medical card from the OMMP, Oregon Medical Marijuana Program, you could have on your purse and me in your backpack. You could have a seat next to you in your car, a pound and a half. It was legal. Yeah, it still is. Any adult can have, no, I think I restricted it, but I don't have a medical card anymore, but yeah, a pound and a half. And I and a half and re over on the freeway and h a half pounds because he was legal to haul that one but not the other 23 pounds or whatever. So they literally subtracted it they just subtracted it from charges. Yeah. That's cool. Why you're in California, you can't travel with more than an ounce. And I can smoke an ounce in a fucking day. So that's bullshit. Yeah. So what's the big soil now with the kids? You gotta have a special soil. Dude, I don't know. I'm out of the loop, man. I've been making my own shit for five years. I just don't care anymore. No. Well, I don't know what is like royal gold. I'm not doing Patrick King, royal gold. Yeah. Yeah, there's and some of that stuff is OK. It's not terrible, but like it's all just the same sort of starter material. No, I know you can Look if you just you know, yeah person not you but I'm saying if a person would just do one thing and one thing on Well, actually three things is go get some viable castings You. It's going to cost you a little bit of money, but it's going to reduce all kinds of costs on wheat plants. You got plants that thrive, not just survive. Are there brands you recommend? None. None. Okay. None. Each of us is on our own in terms of finding a quality source. Yeah, that is good advice. If you add yourself and some kelp and some basalt rock. And if you were to add all that and put the castings aside for a minute, And at the time that you transplant your rooted, like a one gallon or whatever it is, okay, so dig the hole out, and then line that mother with castings, the good stuff, put your plant in there and just gently press the sides in. And you'll have wonderful plants. And you'll have the motivation to get as many castings as you can for the next season. I promise you that, that's a promise. And. Like I said, there's only four between Canada and Mexico that I would buy from and they're one of them. And for you, Aaron, I don't know what happened in the fires, but look for what's the wine valley starts for the nurse Sonoma. Yes Sonoma Valley worm farm or Verma second well, you wouldn't care about them. But vertical flow through beds, where you feed from the top and harvest from the bottom. And if you're just gonna shout out, Jeremy, unwary gun dogs, our buddy again is Bill, he commented a ways back, I wish I could, it's probably gonna be hard to find, but he said he's working on a flow through design and he's gonna pass off the results as soon as he's done. Damn it, I'm miswording what he said, but. Should we bring him on? This guy really knows what he Yeah, I gave. I think I tried. Listen, I tried to get him. Yes, you were you were. You gave him the plans I was trying. I've been trying to get him to do a live with me, but he's he's kind of low key. He likes to like not put his face out there so I can respect that. But you know, maybe if we all nudge him, we can get him on here. We can do audio only, no face, or I'll send him a Mexican wrestling mask. I have a bunch of those. That specific design was done by Dan Holcomb at Oregon Soil Corporation. Yeah, so I actually, I Dan to come join you and he wanted to but is like out or something right now. Cool, because he's like a good, good job, Peter. You're on it, man. I've been emailing people non stop as we're talking about subject like the women from NC State, I emailed both of them. I sent you that shit two days ago, I think, those names that you got just a day or two ago and you've already done all of that research and work amongst hosting and doing all these videos. It's incredible. Yeah, with advance notice, I'm like, oh my God, I know what we're doing. Like, let me see what I can reach out to who's relevant. So let me try. Well, I do have to get. Sorry, go ahead, Jim. Oh, no, I was going to say the other thing that Bar barley added to the. Okay. So the first time you remember, I'm, I'm, I'm buying seeds at Bob's red meal, the bin, you know, book section. And, uh, I came home and, you know, sprouted him. Like we've all done with mung beans or whatever, which by the way, is one of the best beans you can put on your plants is mung bean juice. Yeah. I'm a fan of mung beans. Yeah. As a fertilizer. Like what? That's what black, like fermented black beans are basically mung beans. Right. I think so. Yes. Yeah. I, I, I cook with them all the time. I love like Szechuan pepper and fermented black beans. Yeah, for sure. So anyway, so I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I just because. And so a couple of days later, I put them in the puree food processor, I guess you call it, and then added it five gallons of water and I sprayed two plants, the soil with it, right before it lights up. So the next morning I get up and the lights had already come on, so I unzipped the tent. I really small time, you know, I'm not a major producer at all. Unzip the tent door, and all the leaves and branches were pointing towards the light like they were praying. So that's why I ended up calling was praying hands. And I remember some kid on one of the farms, you sure it's not a boring tone of whoever is asking the dumb question. Yeah. That was okay. Like, so I put up a picture of a Elvis Huxley. Now keep in mind, Elvis Huxley at the age of, you guys are, you're, you from Oxford. This wasn't like Clackamas County Community College. And later in life, he became a really strong friendship with Krishna Murthy, who came out of the Theosophy. I'm gonna tie this all together in a minute, in a Theosophy group, which produced none other than Rudolf Steiner, who was the head of the Theosophist in Germany long before he became Mr. Biodynamic. He was a theosophist. And that's not good or bad, it's just you go to their website, blow you away. There's some really heavies. And so Huxley and Krista Murty remained friends for 25 years until Huxley's untimely death on the same day that John Kennedy was assassinated, November 23rd, 1963. So if you really like mid-century fiction, but really deep. Get anything by Huxley. Doors of Reception was a, as far as his writing career and aberration. Brave New World, that's the one you want to read. Or Chrome Yellow. Yeah, definitely get a copy from the library. You'll be hooked. I think I have 20 of his books on my iPads. So I could wake up and read a couple of chapters of Great New World. Jim, just quickly, you don't use Biochar, do you? Yes, with this qualification. When I look at a product and consider a product. I like to look at both sides of the discussion. And I think some biochar producers have over, okay, there's a lot of promotion and mine's the best and that kind of thing. And I understand that it's merchandising, right? But here's my problem with Biochar. I can make the argument on both sides for using it and not using it. And so when I'm that way with a material, I'm inclined, I just forget it doesn't register with me, because I've taken, you know, over and over and over the same stream. So I know what it's going to do at this point of the cycle, right? And say four plants and two have biochar and two don't. And there isn't a dime's worth of difference. There is a usage, though, that I'm going to investigate in the next week or so is to take biochar and soak it in something that activated whatever you call it, maybe some kelp meal and water, right? And then add that to the material, the substrate for growing mushrooms and replace the vermiculite. The main reason we add vermiculite to a lot of recipes is for moisture hydration level control inside the substrate. I guess I would say that, you know, find a good supplier and if they can tone it down on the bragging, that would be helpful. Not everything is gonna save third world countries. You know what I mean? Sometimes it's just a nice amendment. I don't know. I think with the living soils, as long as the biochar is, as they call it, charged, so you soak it with some sort of nitrogen-based fertilizer and water, and then put that into your soil, it shouldn't be a problem. If anything, it's going to be an erative input. It's going to be a humic breakdown eventually organic matter chart i know of a process um yeah i know of a process where they're making biochar from mycelium blocks that's pretty exciting wow yeah so that's kind of cool. Well, like especially many, not all, but many mushrooms that hobbyists like myself grow, I find a grain spawn to be the path of least resistance. I can get a good colonization and get a garden up. So you have, if you do it in some kind of commercial level, you're gonna have a block about half the size of a shoebox, we'll say. And so be able to take that, like you found out, Aaron, you go to a mushroom company and ask, can I have the blocks? And they're going, please. I mean, this is like a big issue for them getting rid of them and that's kind of what I hope to do is to introduce something that's the same way for both sides. It's the same way with the horse manure and cow manure a lot well sometimes not cow manure but horse manure specifically on the day, you can go pick up spent fruiting blocks from a mushroom farm, and then go do a horse farm and pick up their composted poop piles and mix them together. And that is a suitable compost starting material. Absolutely. And there's another really good book called Mushroom Cultivation, not a very exciting title. And it's digital and printed. I suggest getting the printed. But this is about how to grow mushrooms in our vegetable cards alongside your tomato plants. Big ones like wine caps and I mean we're talking huge mushrooms. Well it adds tilt to the soil and you know the whole bed if you will. Plus it's producing food and every year it's going to get better and better and better. So this book breaks down, okay, like you might wanna consider growing oyster mushrooms here and over here because you got this grass, yeah, there you go, that's the book. Highly, highly, highly, I've even bought it for four or five friends. I had to, you know, ship it to them. It's that good of a book and it covers everything. But the most important in my frame of reference is that it shows you how to use it in your garden. Am I doing next level graphic work, by the way, for the audience? That's great. Killing it, Peter. Yeah. It's a wonderful book though. Three and a half hours in and you're still crushing it. We got, yeah. What do we have? Like, uh, yeah. 300 people watching. And I love that he's going to tie all these, he's going to tie all these stray conversations together into one grand conclusion soon. Okay. I'll do it right now. Real simple. Here's the coots mix. Get the best compost and or Verma compost. You can spend, put your money on the table, get some scratch in the game. Blow off anything in a grocery store. You can't get it at the feed store. I don't know, move? You know, I mean, it's available. California, for example, is one of the largest horticultural states. So you're gonna have nursery supply houses, not grocery stores. You get the idea. Get kelp into your regimen and basalt or granite. Probably basalt because we have a lot of volcanoes in the western states, right? The salt's probably expensive in Oklahoma, we'll say. But you should be able to get granite. Tombstone industry is a good one for that. Because when they cut the letters into the piece of slab, you get powder. Well, that's what you want. This ain't rocket science. Oh. Yeah. Your ground level knowledge is incredible. Your feet on the ground and your head in the clouds, dude. It's insane. It's the microdosing. Yeah. Oh yeah. I think, I think, I'm not trying to be political. I can be, but it's not pretty. I think we're gonna enter a time that people are gonna value what it takes to earn a dollar. And they need good information on how to grow their own food and not get ripped off by, well, he's such a nice guy over there at Kmart or Target or something. I'm just gonna continue doing that because I think it's important that I can help people grow better plants and produce better food for themselves and their families and their neighbors. Like that program, Plant a road, put an extra row of something in and give it away. There's really need for things like this. And I think it's gonna get more so in that direction. I don't know. I didn't wanna be political, but I think just on a human level, I agree. There isn't a good one. Okay, if I told you my top five, number one and number two, I never got a plant past day 23 before I chopped it. I mean, I'm flabbergasted. The most expensive soil you can buy. Remember, I'm in the middle of it. This is where, okay, like, roots organic, there are big, raw innovations. Okay. Cute packaging. I like the claims about Yucca being a rare desert planet. Really ever been to Yucca Valley, California? Go to the Midwest. It's everywhere. They pull it out. It's an invasive plant. Of course it is. I mean, this is a rare plant. Okay, what are you're wanting is the surfactant qualities or in a soil we call it a wedding agent. But if we spray it on the leaves, it's now a surfactant. You want really good surfactants man get soap net shells from mountain rosaries and make the most powerful pesticide you can ever use because it deconstructed the eco skeleton on many insects. How's that one? And it breaks down within 36 hours. Pretty cool, huh? And here's the best part. Say you buy incredible. I don't know, say you bought five pounds or something, you know, and to make a batch, you'd want to put in like, say, a quarter cup. I'm just using round numbers in one of those paint bags that you get a strainer. Okay, put that in five gallons. Do not do not air raid or look like a TV comedy show or the washing machines explodes. You'll have fun up to the sea. I'm not joking. So don't aerate it. Just stir that. I've done that with other Yeah, yeah. Okay, so just stir it. You know, every time you walk with every three or four hours, something like that, right? No, no, no big deal. So the next day, you pull the bag out and you hang it, you want to let them dry like they were when you put them in the bag. Because you're going to be able to do this five times. So that's how much you should get out of it. This thing has a PPM of 250,000 PPM of saponins. That's 25%. Now you just pour this into a Chapin 1949 model sprayer.A PIN 1949. When look at him the other day, they're a buck 30 on Amazon, the best spray you'll ever get. No plastic at all. It's all brass, steel, epoxies. It's the real deal. And you spray it on your plants. Want to do it at evening time. Always never put pesticides, whether they're biolite, whatever. Always put them on as late as you can in the day. Certainly not in the mid. There you go. That's it. I made them famous. That's the concrete sprayers that's all grass look at that that's killer so traditionally i've i've sprayed in the mornings while stomata is open before the sun comes out to interact with the plant in a trans trans um what is that? Translaminar way or what enters the tissue, but not systemically. What are the advantages of spraying an evening? The biggest one is that in the daytime, okay, plants produce terpenoids and terpenes as defenses against, a book you have to read is What a Plant Knows. This is by a highly acclaimed, real legitimate PhD at University of Tel Aviv, I believe. What a plant knows. This will explain terpenes and terpenoids better than you're going to hear at Cana Con. Let's say that a plant will produce, we'll take one that's most well known for unfortunate reasons. Little Little. Okay, the one of the biggest producers that is of course the I can't even say these words, a culinary lavender as opposed to medicinal which has no lent little bit has camphor. That's the one that's really beneficial because camphor plugs up the air vent on the egg. So the larva can't breathe and they explode. The first time I did it, I looked at the underside of the lid and it looked like a nuclear bomb went off. They were just exploded eggs. And I almost cried, you know, it was touching. That will take little so the plant that's what the orchid man comes in a synthetic form of little comes and sprays at your house on contract basis. So it's an effective pesticide not going to question that one. But it's nighttime. And the plan is more susceptible to Fungal invasion the plant can take that little little hydrocarbon and deconstruct it and turn it into camper in about 15 minutes That's how active the plant is in its defense systems. So all the silliness about it, you're going to control terpene and terpenoid productions because pinings the terpenoid of the week or something by adding Canadian butt hairs is insanity. I mean, you've got 450 million years of plant history, all right, up against you. Some rules you can undo, or you know, reimagine. That would be a good one. But so at night, getting that saponins is a not only is it a good pesticide, but it's an amazing fungicide. Even in soil use it as a soil soak so that's my uh that's my claim to fame on saponins i learned that from the uh there's a big uh japan excuse me chinese garden in vancouver bc not the one across the river, important, the one in Canada. It's world famous. And they have staff, most of them were trained at Beijing University in Botany, not, oh no, you got a Cal-Mag issue, or how about a bar on magnesium deficiency, or whatever we're doing this week. So they use saponins exclusively in big areas of the park as a pesticide and fungicide. That speaks volumes to me. Finally had to do the same moment. Sorry. So let me, the Matthew Zenthinol question, do you see that that I just posted? What is it in soap? Yeah, what is... Go ahead. Soap nuts deconstructing exoskeletons. So basically, how do saponins deconstruct exoskeletons? Well, it removes the protective coating. I mean, think about this. Is it a chitinolitic effect? Yes. Okay. That was his specific question was... Good question by the way. Yeah, that is a smart dude right there. Matthew Zenthinol, if anybody's not aware of him, check out his YouTube channel, Zenthenol, one of my good buddies and mentors as well. So should we- Well, just quickly, because Hash asked the same question like four times. How much granite powder per gallon? Well, it's more to two cubic foot and a cubic foot is 7.2 gallons. Let's just call it seven and a half, you know? Okay. So a gallon, so that's going to put you about 115 cups. And And so you wanna add two cups of your basalt or your granite rock dust. Now remember, the soil that I'm helping you build is going to last many years. So this is a one time hit. You're gonna easily be able to do five years and probably longer because it is truly a living soil. It's not living because you added this silly concoction or that. This is basic microbiology. It's not so if we want fungal colonies. Is it three cups or two cups? Two cups, I'm sorry. Three cups or two cups. Two cups I'm sorry. Two cups of rock. Two okay. On the on the blog, I think you have three. Well, yes, if you're using basalt cascade minerals. You don't need to use that much. I'm even exceeding their recommendation. But this is really the quality stuff. If you saw the machinery that turns the chunks into rock dust, I mean, this is really high tech. This is like, yeah, I've always wanted to see that and how they do it. They're really cool. The one gentleman that was there, I don't know if he was their consultant or co founder, but he spent 45 years with the US Geological Service, based here in the northwest. And I had an opportunity at a trade show to spend almost two hours with him. And he was explaining the geology going back a couple hundred million years, why things are the way they are in the northwest or at least the part of that's why we grow such good barley here it's the volcanic soils over in eastern Oregon and Washington that's why we grow some of the best wheat in lagoons uh in the Palouse country so it's the volcanic soils that it makes. You look around the world, they talk about Hawaiian coffee, why? Because it has volcanic soil. Well, that's what I was gonna ask you. How good would the rock dust be from like the black Hawaiian rock? If you're living there, oh yeah, you're down in LA. It comes down to your shipping costs. The big one here in the Northwest is Cascade Minerals in Redmond, Oregon. And I'm sure that they're distributing it. I would check with places like Orange County Farm Supply and Testin. You'll find it is this not. It's a lot easier today than it was when they were first released four years ago, or five or whatever it was. Right. Highly recommended getting to salt or granite, that para magnet magnetism in the soil, like you read and posted puts things in order and keeps them in order. Oh yeah, and don't check pH or runoff. That one boggles my mind. I mean, and ask somebody that's advocating this, do you know what pH even stands for? Potential hydrogen. Yeah. You know, I guess I have a lot to do. It's the money exchange system in the soil. It's how everybody pays everybody else. Exactly. That's all cation exchange is based on hydrogen. Yeah. You know, it's just, I don't know. So- I'm the one person responsible for all this information, I can point it back to 1979. And every Grove book that cop or when it came after copied that gibberish. Okay, and so the stage was set for insanity. That's why the first commercial I don't know about California, I can't speak to that. But man, the first commercial ones in Oregon here in 17. What a disaster. I've never seen such silliness. I've been around a lot of greenhouses. I've never seen some of them as advanced as the ones I was in. I just look at them right now and say, have you ever done this? No, but I have a friend whose brother is gonna do it by cell phone. I'm gonna test you. I'm a botanist man. I mean for one. So a while ago the American one asked, please ask Kuz to comment about some peers. So like he mentioned John Kemp, Falaine Ingham. Are there people out there that you've been following and respect on a real level? The main one because I attended his school back in the 80s is ecology action. And his name is John Jevons. And he will show you how to 800 square feet, 800 square feet will feed a family of four, including grains. You're not gonna eat any meat, but you know, I mean, we're talking about a sustainable diet. He wrote the book, How to Grow More Vegetables in the Smallest Summit Area Than you ever thought possible, some title like that. And it's biointensive where you plant things on center very closely together. What that does is the more roots you have in your soil, the better the hydration level will stabilize because most water we feed our plants goes up as evaporates. The other thing is that you water from the top down with misters so that you limit the ability of weed seeds to get launched down in your soil level. I mean, I can't go through the long, but those are some of the, and that's where the stoners took off with the sea of green. It's off this, which is based on the French technique, which goes back to China 4,500 or 5,000 years ago. So nothing's new, just a renamed things. It's a very good way to grow vegetables, to produce a lot of food in a small amount of area. And he really gets into companion planning, things that are gonna reduce insect problems, what have you. A very good book. Speaking of companion planning, because we were talking about this the other day, What do each of you like to put in with the cannabis? I guess in season and out of season. I like using fenugreek. Are you available to Indian? Personally, if I'm companion planting, it's a focused banker system for Swarovski. So if I have peppers in the garden, it's for Swarovski Eye and Cucumaris. If I have marigold it's to till in to prevent harmful nematodes. I don't use trap plants because I think that that's just that just brings pests into your garden. I know some people do successfully that's just not something I do. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Let me add, Neem and Karanja are all our meals. They're completely unrelated. Neem is a mahogany family and Karanja is closer to an alfalfa plant. So again, both of them contain high levels of compounds that destroy pathogenic nematodes. So there's that you won't be dealing with you put some neem into your soil mix, or Karanja and you won't be dicking around with the outside indoor or wood container or row however you're growing. I can't stress it enough. I've actually never encountered pathogenic nematodes, but it's just always something I've been aware of, because I've heard such horror stories. But I've always, I tilled marigolds into my soil a long time ago, and maybe those compounds still exist, I don't know. So randomly we also have a UC Davis nematologist coming on the show. Wow. I think in the next week. To talk nematodes. No, that's amazing. I'll be sure to tune in. Well, you should probably jump on with me because I don't know enough to ask intelligent nematode questions. Yeah, just shoot me a link and I'll if I'm free, I'll do it. Sure. All right. So do we have any other questions from the peanut gallery or? Yeah, I think that's it. Should we close with that? Dude, you know what's ironic? I had like this, dude, I think we're at four hours, wait 10. We're almost at four hours. So I had this thing I wanted to tie in while we were chatting. And it's kind of ironic that I don't, there was never a point that I could tie it in because. I was gonna say, and just quickly before you tie it in, Jim, if you can, everybody wanted to get the PDFs you were mentioning of the research that you've been into. So if you can share it, then we'll get it out there for everyone. Absolutely. Absolutely. And everybody appreciates it. Listen, this is peer reviewed, not some kid that mommy let them grow a plant in her garage, and all of a sudden they're a consultant know, I mean, there's bad science, but this goes this goes beyond the pale. You know, I'll give you an example. Okay, neem and garage are both fungicides. Okay, so the read is what their fungicides in the destroy the colonies in the soil. Okay, nothing to be further from the truth. I use Neem and Karanja in my mushroom mix. I'm growing fungi. And if this was like killed was a broad spectrum fungicide. I couldn't do that. But it does do is suppress the pathogenic molds and what have you, and keeps your substrate clean for the one you're trying to grow. So widely used in Asia. I mean, you know, does anybody ever read a book or, you know, before they start just posting stuff? I mean, it just blows my mind. I know what you're talking about. You're talking about the one guy, I think somebody asked about, you know, neem killing the soil fungus. Yeah, sure. And the problem is there's just this information isn't out there. You know, that's why we're waiting for your book, Coot. When is that shit dropping? Soon I learned something about on an iPad setup is a laptop. Tablets as good as they are, especially the iPad pro series, right? As good as they are, there's still a tablet And there's some functions. They're just a lot easier to do on a Mac OS where I can run BB edit, you know, and coding and do some things like that because there's just so many restrictions on an iPad. At the end of the day, it's a tablet. yeah, it's great for, you know, hitting Instagram and whatever. But I wouldn't use it to run a business, you know, so I'm gonna, I was, I'm gonna probably go buy a computer, because it would go a lot quicker. But you know, the bottom line is, know your ingredients. Choose wisely. Don't get let off the, you know, this and that, you know, I don't care blood meals. What? What's the NPK is like 12 something something there. 20. Zero zero or something. Yeah. You know, so what? I mean, so what? You know, when you cut that plant open and dissect and do an analysis on the chlorophyll, is it any different? Did that nitrogen like do something special? See what I mean? It's just I don't know you could I guess take a dog a hunting dog when you paid like fifty thousand dollars for it which believe it or not is not at the top end of that world believe it or not and you know you could bring it home and feed it uh Wonder Bread with Oscar Mayer baloney. That's your right, I guess, or something under the Articles of Confederation or something. But it's a poor use of the animal, the training, and what went into it. And what I see going on in the cannabis scene has gone on for a lot of years. And the $50,000 you spent on it. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah. And, but in the cannabis world, it's like, we're just going to piss on everything and we're going to do something that's better. It's faster. It's, you know, it's going to say third world countries or something, you know, I can get 10 rappers to use it, I can get my own YouTube channel or something. But I don't get it. I'm glad I'm at the end of my cycle and have fun. I couldn't even imagine turning over a pound of weed that I grew to somebody for $500. I mean, I do something else, get a job as a greeter at Walmart or something, you know, or run security on the Chuck E. Cheese's, you know, in downtown Oregon City or something. Yeah, like you, I'm not gonna Go because it's a lot of work to grow good plants. I don't care what you're growing I don't care if you're growing tomatoes or there's work involved. It isn't just well I planted it so this should work You know, you got to do some things right you got a home and the other you know, keep things under control and And then eventually you gotta stop and you gotta write a book about it. Yeah, you gotta enjoy it. Gardening should be fun. It shouldn't be this exercise in chemistry. And that's I think what annoys me more than anything is that that industry which disappeared in Oregon and Yahoo, the grocery industry, they saw that this was a process of chemistry and it's not. There's chemistry involved, but it's about botany. It's about agronomy. And just because you think, and because somebody came out, you know, and read a label. I mean, I'll give you one. This one is a freebie. There's a product called Turpinator. Love the name. Great graphic. You know, okay. The Turpinator. And all you need is Arnold and a, you know, after and a three day drunk and you got it down, right? And for the voice. So I look at it one day in a grocery store and it says sulfate or potash. Well, that's widely used mined material approved for organic food production, right? It's just like limestone or, you know, it's no big deal. Okay, and that's what's in this. And so I called over to concentrate the organic farm supply here in Portland. And I asked him what a 50 pound bag was, and it was around $21 before your friends and family discount, you know. So I went back to the Jug in this grocery store, out of business now, by the way. And I figured it out. And using their label, I didn't file this, they did, right? There was less than 75 cents worth of sulfate of potash in this 75 or $80 jug and inert ingredients. That's water. That's a freebie that the Congress gave food and fertilizer manufacturers. They didn't have to call it water. Here's how you make that for free. Yeah. And here's how you make that for free. You burn some wood from your land or your area. Then you take the charcoal and the ash and you soak it in a bucket of water overnight and the next day filter the hard stuff with a sieve and The liquid you feed your plants and guess what you just made turpenator for free. Yeah, I Mean really? You know, I know the ones that used to really give me where the liquid silica products. They're all made with the same thing from the same company, Agsil. I forget the number, but anyway, it doesn't matter. And it's a potassium silicate. I mean, I don't care what the label says. Or the one was it from that guy up in Vancouver. Oh yeah, Big Mike in his Advanced Nutrients, which is neither, okay. Advanced Nutrients, yeah. Okay, so his- Never trust a company that puts Advanced in the name because they're basic. They're not even that that they're just, I mean, what a joke. But um, you know, I don't care if you call it wet Betty, you know, it's still potassium silicate, you know, and you can imply that she's got a proof of a date, you know, in our car. I mean, you know, I mean, come on. I mean, this is too much cartoon, 1980s cartoon of Rooney. You will go into a grocery and it's like walking into an auto parts store, just plastic jugs of bullshit. I mean, you know, make an investment. Yeah, I wrote Big Mike off. What What's that? I wrote a big mic off when he was... I wrote a big mic off when he was snorting CBD crystals on Instagram. I wrote him off when he was here in Portland before he was from Kentucky, some po-duck town just south of Louisville. And I don't even know how to pronounce it. I lived there for a while in my youth before I sobered up. And so he was here in Portland, had some scam going on, some nude program. And then all of a sudden he met up with the Romanian investor and thus was born Advanced nutrients. And then later was a worn out Interpol for his partner, the investor for child rape in Romania. So he had Interpol looking for him. Nice, nice group of folks. Go ahead. And I was just gonna say, you know, you can make this, you can make anything stupid. It's not difficult. You just need some sock puppets and you know, but we're talking about gardening. This really isn't that difficult. I proved it. Yeah, at the end of the day, we we we are examining the complexities, but we're looking for a simple solution. And that is a perfect segue into what I wanted to say about how we never really got the chance to break this down, funnel this back down into what is the solution. What we did, we did actually. But that is sort of what represents ultimately is the Jack Kerouac saying, quote, one day I will find the right words and they will be simple. But here we are for now, milling through the complexities. I know. And here we are now milling through the complexities of of this stuff, but really all we want to do is get to the simple bottom of it. Right. Well, I wrote this when I was 21. And, you know, we're all anecdotes of non-freedom. We struggle with our minds to rationalize functionalism. And in the end, we've accessed simplicity of our life. And I honestly feel if a person believes that cannabis can and be a medicine That then and it has spiritual properties then I guess what I'm saying is that I don't want to consider using something because It sounds cool or some solution in search of a problem That's what I feel about magnesium, for example. Cal-Mag, what does it even mean? There used to be a search engine called, it was Scribe or something like that, and it was strictly science. There were no blogs, there was no blab sheets from manufacturers, it was strictly peer-reviewed studies. And so I started typing in stoner terms one day just to see what I could see. So I put in Cal-Mag lockout. Nothing. I mean, nothing. And these were archives that went back to the middle 19th century, okay, when the Brits built the first true greenhouse as we know it today in London still standing in the botanical society. Look it up sometime, it'll blow your mind. But I once downloaded a book from one of the sites that has free books and the title was Dealing with Molds and Greenhouses. So I thought well this is good and then I opened it up a digital book, right? So I opened it up and it was dated 1870 so I'm just saying some things don't change the same challenges And it's it, you. And I always ask the people that are promoting this stuff, if you guys are so good, why aren't you sitting in front of the UN taking billion dollar contracts because they need to feed people? It's not about Johnny getting his dank on. What are you contributing to the world of agriculture? And they don't have an answer. It's all about, well, look how much we sold. Yeah. Do you get any repeat business? But I think the scary thing is some of them have convinced, like I think the Monsanto's of the world have, you know, at points convinced like, you know, third world countries to get on the dependency and fertilizer companies too. And then I think you eventually have a backlash of the farmers sometimes in places where they're like, what the fuck did you hook us on? Yep. And the issue with the synthetic fertilizers and agricultural sectors like you're talking about is that you're required to add more every year. It is almost like being addicted to heroin or something. So this I mean look at the soils what we've done to the soil since the end of World War II. So that would be 75 years ago. And that was when in the 50s, all the Monsanto products that came online, they're still here. Like I said, NAA, I found in some retail garbage rooting compounds is a fungicide, not the acetic acid. I mean, the others may be synthetic, but at least they're based on real world plant created compounds like endocytic acid, what have you. You probably read it early in your career about taking and growing and not growing but harvesting willow shoots and use that as a rooting agent. Well, that's how it was first created 100 years ago down at Oregon State in Provales. And they did it was a multi year project. And this was born salicylic acid, rooting agents, which are still used at the commercial level, you're not going to find it at Home Depot or Lowe's, you got to go to a source. And, you know, on Branch is side note on Willow branches, setting up land in Oklahoma, have to put in a well, the well guys come out, they pull two Willow branches out of the bed of their truck to which to find your water. Cool. And I'm sitting here like, I think it's the salicylic acid in the willow that's finding the water. I think I figured it out. And they're like, I don't know what you're talking about, but it works. And you know, it's cool. No, no, it makes you know, you know, it's amazing. The first time that I actually started doing it after a couple of weeks into the gross cycle of applying aloe vera gel. I would just go, like I said, go to the Mexican market, buy a frond, and then I'd get two batches out of it and just put that into the water and hydrate it overnight. And I'd add kelp to it also, a quarter cup of kelp for five gallons, and then a little bit of fobic acid. I'm real big on fobic acid, the good stuff. Be careful. There's a lot of garbage out there. And what I saw immediately, I don't measure everything like, well, how much more was it? Oh, well this time I got 130 grams, you know, whatever the deal is. I look at how healthy the plant did. Did it cause any problems? No. Did it weaken its defense system? That's always the big one for me. I mean, I've kind of fine tuned this down to where why would I want to use something that would degrade those materials that I worked in some cases over a year and a half to create. You'll see when you become a worm head, you become a wacko. You'll see, you know, you're thinking like two years ahead world, you know, how you can grow it. You know, if you took all the worms out of the, you know, like some. If the worms disappeared tomorrow the world and have less than four weeks to before complete collapse. So they're important in our gardens. And they create the most high highest quality material you can use in your... Here's another reason why a grocery store wouldn't want to sell it to you. Because the other way to sell you a problem, right? And then you keep coming back for a solution to the problem. What if they actually sold you a soil that was well cut out and used quality materials? What would that be worth to, I don't care what you're growing, strawberries on your deck or a culinary, you know, herb plot on your deck or something. You wouldn't care about the price, would you? Especially if it was better next year than it was this year. But they wouldn't be able to sell you anything. It's a long-term investment. That's why it's called soil building. Soil building doesn't mean we'll dump it out, we'll yell to get fresh soil. I still don't know what that means, but having been around a lot of processing plants where soil is packed, if you went to one, you would never buy a bagged soil again. That's a promise. It's like how no one would eat hot dogs if they saw what was jammed in there. Exactly. Exactly. Well, here's my favorite one. Okay. So in the mixers are turbine mixers, horizontal mixers, and they have these big comb bottom tanks. And as the technician puts in the batch number, whatever it is, it automatically drops the material down from, you know, so much of this so much of that into this auger type system, eight minutes to mix you got to run another batch. I mean, you got trucks lined up, all this stuff, Home Depots and Costco's and all around the country, right? During the springtime. So at the bottom of these mixers, you build up fines, really extremely like powder stuff. So several years ago, Fox Farm came out with a product called Light Warrior. It had these really large hunks of perlite. I'll get to that in a second. And it had some of this powder that they give away. But it looks like, you know, there's like humus in there or something, you know, visual. Understand if you look up the Perlite Institute, it can validate what I'm saying. There's actually an institute called the Perlite Institute. And it's used in like, say, a Costco, those tilt up walls. In those concrete walls, it's added as a insulation. So there's like factories everywhere, it's cheaper than shit. And people were paying $22 for a bag of this perlite with some dust, peat moss dust. And it said Fox from another bag. It was part of their moonshine mix. They had ocean ocean forest, they had happy frog, and a bag of light warrior. And I asked the guy on IC Mag, he had identified himself as a management there. And I said, did you guys go out for like a five day drunk and come up with this recipe? He just made shit. So that's when I got my first play nice with the advertisers. So another time, I won't say his name cause he had had problems but he was big famous breeder, you know, like You're really a dick if you don't grow the string kind of thing So it puts up a picture of a field of trees as they call them the problem was is that it had been run through Photoshop because the shadows on the trees were going in all different directions. So unless the unlikely possibility was at a universe where there's more than one sun or whatever, right? And I was only too willing to point that out. And he went ballistic. I'm gonna hunt you down. I was like, I was blabbing my ass off. Okay, Mr. Canna Gangster. And yeah, I bought seeds one time in my career once, 1988 from Neville, the seed bank. Okay, the famous Hayes Northern Lights. There's pitiful and then there was this. And they were like, you got to put it in that year in 1988, $20 a seed was a lot of money. I don't know what it'd be today. It'd have to be over 50, wouldn't it? $50 a seed for that shit. Yeah. Okay. They it's, I think it's I do Northern Lights. Hayes is like, you're probably not going to spend less than a hundred dollars a seat nowadays. That's like a rare, you know, it's hot cake. Really? Well, basically you're saying the stuff Neville sold you wasn't very good. Oh yeah, it was terrible. And as the industry- But now people look for those unique varietals that they can claim they have the one and only. Even if it's ditch fucking Siberian dishweed or something. Yeah, like the big move to auto flowers. I was hysterical when I got some kind of a notification from Amazon or any way that, what's his name, the Teaming with Microbes guy. Yeah, Jeff Lowenfels. Yeah, wrote a book on auto flowers. And have you ever seen the pictures of his plants? They're garbage, dude. Yeah, it's like, enough said. Yeah, I look we we call it what it was back in the 80s. Siberian ditch weed. How did it become the premier way to grow? Not's like I used to have on my, like I said, once you devolve a wolf down to a Chihuahua, you can't go back. I'm not impressed. Well, have you tried some of the recent autos? Because I think what they'll say in its defense is that the first iterations of autos sucked, but more recently, like the Mephistos of the world and other people breeding autos are improving them. I wish them all the best. I don't remember, there were two seed companies 32 years ago. There was Neville and his, the seed bank. And the other one was the SSSC, the Super Sativa Seed Club. And after the big blow up, they morphed sensei season Holland Netherlands Okay, so you can still get find the catalogs online the original 1988 But on okay on the Sensei seeds Their main breeding stock was centered around a strain called Afghani then hashtag and numeral one Afghani number one and They stay in the catalog that they bought that from sacred seeds down in Southern Oregon. That's all true. That's an organization that predates, we're going back to the forties. And they were like the really behind the scenes guys. And they didn't get involved in the whole Dutch when they came over with their briefcases full of money. But this group sold one seed. And this is there in the catalog. This isn't me. This is what they state that they went through 1000 seeds to find find a keeper That's how feral The Afghani or was popular called indica strange They were introduced in my opinion for canopy control I Just to repeat you look at all those strange talked about, whatever, going back 50 years, they were all sativas. The Panama Red, you know, all the stuff out of Coolicon and Jalisco and other parts of Mexico, Baja, all sativas, O'Hockenspears, stuff with legends, Mishra Khan, the green line from Guerrero, all the stuff from Jamaica which came out of Africa on the slave boats, all sativas, all sativas. My opinion is that for the most part Things kind of got mongrelized Try to find a really cerebral sativa It's pretty difficult There's it is almost impossible and I've been, I've been trying to source a few strains that are supposed to provide those kinds of effects like Alaskan Thunderfuck and Durban Poison and like original Columbians, Red Congolese. These are strains. I mean, I have one right now. And to my understanding, that cerebral effect in the sativa is usually found in some sort of entourage effect where beta carofilene is the sort of the flagship of the terpenes. East Coast Salar D, my cut of East Coast sourdee that I have is high in beta carafialine and gives you that cerebral effect. It's not like I've found it in one or two other land races, but it's pretty close. Right. The best seeds I ever got was from Africa. And the person that collected the seeds and gave them to me had traveled in several areas of Africa. Sorry. Okay, can you hear me Yeah, I had to plug it. Okay. He had been several areas collected fabrics. They would then sell to designers, one of a kind, you know, tribal stuff. And he picked up seeds and he put them between two. That was the style then between two Frisbees, one inside the other, and that's how you traveled around through buds. It wasn't uncommon to be in Southern California living in Orange County on the coast, you have Frisbees in your car kind of thing. That was the thinking behind me. They'll never look in the Frisbees. Yeah, right. So I started breaking the buds apart because he had them all labeled and you know, like cool stuff. The this and the that. And I just, you know, stoner ran. And so I ended up with a bunch of seeds that were mixed. I saved the seeds, but I didn't isolate them. And I gave them to somebody, all of them. And then what he did with the naming conventions was an embarrassment. To the point I had to finally send him an email saying, Hey, I'd appreciate if you didn't mention, you don't need to mention me in your diatribe, promotional thing. So there you go. It's way back like 10, a little bit more, maybe 12 years ago, when the whole OG Kush thing blew up, you know, 918 and Larry's cutting on Larkey. So I made a point of getting cuts from that from a certified source according to blah, blah, blah. Okay. So I grew them all. I've never used so many bamboo sticks to hold up a plant. I mean, it was a biological nightmare. Like really? The first time I ever saw cookies, I see, Meg, I thought it was an article from The Onion. You know, satire, like National Lampoon. You're growing that? Really? Oh my God. Yeah. But you know, when a consultant says to me, well, you know, it looks like a lot of, you know, trimming. Wow. Yeah, that'd be a real selling point against your company. You're just gonna end up with big buds. And they're gonna smell a lot. Yeah. So, yeah, I have to laugh. I've to every flavor of the cannabis scene, you know, the Indo Expo, a regional one here called... I only went to one, it was too embarrassing. I got hoodwinked into working at a booth on a potting soil product. I spent most of the day swatting gnats out of my face from this bag of shit. Then having to pitch people on it. Oh, no, I wouldn't. This is what I use myself. I can vouch for it. No. Because right across the way was a company that had featured George Cervantes. My memories of George Cervantes was in his first book about how you want to put soil in the oven and bake it so you kill all the germs. You mean, you don't mean Jorge Cervantes, you mean George Van Patten. Yeah, right. Yeah, I want to make sure we're throwing the right person under the bus right now. Oh, yeah. No, no, it's the same fucking person. But he goes by a pseudonym when he's talking about cannabis. Well, it changed. All right. When he first had a growth start, there were five growth stores in the United States at that time. And he had one of them. Where was he based? Portland. Oh, Portland. Okay. Yeah. Southeast foster. Right off the 205 freeway. And he had this silly ass book. I mean, stupid. Beyond belief. And remain stupid through the like 30th printing. And every wannabe stoner writer had to like kowtow to Cervanti's book and repeat the same horse shit. But yeah, anyway, so to get so ready, you want to kill the germs, man. So you put it in oven. So I asked him one time, so what if I have a lot of soda? I need to get a pizza oven. Do you think maybe Red Robin pizza, they would do that for me on a subcontract basis, bake my, bake my soda. And he was just like, face got all twisted up, you know, because it was too logical of a question. Put the pizza in the soil when you're done in the oven and it adds the organic matter, dude. It's good. It's good for you. So yeah, yeah, that's yeah. Anyway, so when Black Thursday hit Operation Green Merchant, the DEA hit every grocery store at the same time on the same day, the same hour from Maine to LA, from Portland or Seattle down to Miami. So not only did they get the shipping records. Well, wait, are we tying Dave Watson back into the conversation? Isn't that who or who leaked all that information? Oh, no, they got it from High Times Magazine. That was the joke. They nailed the advertisers. And because Cervantes, now you got to remember, I love this. So when he, he can't, he lived in Eastern Oregon, that's where he grew up, which is like, think Wyoming on a bad side. Just quickly, Leicon Flo said, Jorge will sell you the oven too. Cool. What a leader. You know you're in bad trouble when you open a book and there's an ad in there for ocean forest soil. But anyway, I digress. So. Oh, shit. Oh, so George, when he came here, he worked for a couple of nurseries for a while. You know, that's, you know, strong back beats a good brain kind of thing, job. Moving shit around and you're a mule. But he kind of observed some things. So then he morphed into George Cervantes. And when they hit on Operation Green Merchant, he left town, and he disappeared for the Statue of Limitations, seven years. And then when he came back, he was now Jorge Cervantes. Wow. All the way from pigs knuckle Eastern Oregon right on the Idaho border. But every writer, I mean, some of these guys lived in and around Laguna under their pseudonyms. They wrote under their pseudonyms, obviously, or known to plume, whatever you want to call it. So the whole thing was a scam from the word go. Nobody that was involved in it denied that. It was how to promote growth stores and the kickbacks. You had the biggest one with the sunshine distributing or sunlight distributing. It's now part of Smith America Grow SMG. Yeah, they sold out up here $350 million. So that's why gross stores kind of disappeared. Because they could carry credit that the new owners can or won't SMG. They're used to dealing with the Home Depot right? Home Depot doesn't ask for 60 day line of credit on potting soil. Like a grocery store would. They try and sell you the commercial card if you, the credit, the commercial credit line, if you, if you go there too many times and spend too much money. I'm going to make it a project to help you and I'm going to do one right now. I just thought there's a turkey producer south of Sacramento called Dietzel. It's organic turkeys. You'll find it. Okay, and they've been around since the 20s, so almost 100 years. One of the grandsons or something like that got involved in making compost. And I can speak to the quality and the integrity of the family and everything. It's German name, Deitst\u00e4l, like diesel with a T in it. Okay. It's D-I S T E L. There you go. Good turkeys, by the way, too. Thank you. True free range. Cool. Yeah, really good turkeys. There's one in Pasadena, California, too, that they offer on the holidays. But anyway, they have good compost. And so you could use that and use that as your main component in your worm bin. And now you're doing what I said before, you're gonna start out with good material and make better castings, especially with some amendments like we've already talked about, Barty, Kelp, and Neve and what have you. You'd have premium castings for your food garden. Maybe not a business deal. You could work into that. I mean, that's not difficult. Yeah, it's got to be close to a record, right? We're going. I just wanted to thank both of you gentlemen. I had a good time. Well, we should do the round too soon. We'll bring on some guests. We'll have a musical guest. We'll bring some long lost friends on. Yeah, I was basically, I was trying, like, who is the guy who actually came on for a minute? He emailed me and said he was having trouble connecting to the audio. Oh, Doug at the Northwest Red Worms. Yeah, but, uh, well, he lives in the hinder lands of Portland. He's got a worm farm, you know what I mean? He's out, he's out there. The guy has, him. Are you talking about Rhonda Schurm? I'm talking about the two NC state women. deep dive with like the two NC State women, him. Are you talking about Rhonda Sherman? Yeah. Wow. And whose other woman? Yeah. Yasmin Cardoza? Yeah, Yasmin. Right, right. You're kidding. What? No, I reached out to both of them, and then I also reached out to the, who's the older guy? Dr. Clive Edwards. Yeah, I reached out to him too. So usually it's like three days later where people are like, I just saw your message. Like what, where, when? Oh man, that's like, that's when I want to sit back and listen. Those are like, you know, the ace of that sector. Nobody, I have more respect for Clive Edwards than anybody else in the world of agronomy. His book, Vermiculture Technology, is mandatory for anybody wanting to do world-class castings, and it's actually an anthology of about 36 writers from around the world. So the level of science is extraordinary. It's going to cover different atmospheric conditions or weather patterns, what have you. If you use that book, in fact, John Holcomb that designed the Verma machine was based on John Holcomb's work with Dr. Clive Edwards and Rhonda Sherman. Rhonda Sherman is a major contributor and I can't remember the gentleman's name at the University of Hawaii. He's one of like the lead botanist there at that university. So it's a really good book. It is expensive. It's gonna earn you probably about a buck and a quarter. And I don't know if they have a digital version or not, but it's just look at it as an investment. You're never going to find that collection of material that thorough anywhere else in the world. And just to put a little bit of perspective the first actual testing on Burma compost didn't occur until 74. That't that long ago. It's not even 50 years So there's a lot of garbage out there and that's what this book puts to rest and all the silliness Right Become self-sufficient man. Did you get a handle on your own soil. And you know. And Rustica said, shut up and take my money. I think that's sort of the sentiment we all feel with you, Coot, but you don't charge for this stuff. So we're just, we're ready to intake when, you know, whenever you're ready to drop that book. I really got sidelined with a new GoPro, Osmo Pocket, and I'm looking seriously at a really good drone with some fun toys. Yeah, why not? I mean, you know, you only live once and I don't, you know, I had a good life, you know, it was a good run. So I don't have anybody to leave. You are senescing beautifully. What's that? You are senescing beautifully. Yeah, that's that word I could never pronounce. I never use it. This is a truthiness. On the Tio plant, the one I was talking about, the Kandahar and the Thai. Even outdoors going eight months. If you're waiting for those trikes to turn amber, you might want to let it go another year. In fact, indoors they never turn amber. There is crystal clear on day seven when they start forming and the day you harvest all you see is difference. Does that matter like the height? Some are short, some are tall. That's a question I don't. Does it matter for what? Like the strength of the, you know, whatever. Does it have any relevance? I would say it's a measurement. And my experience is just a measurement of the maturity of the trichome. Like how tall it gets is how old it is. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. One time about in the last year and a half or two years ago, I, that one, I took it to 18 weeks Because I was bored and lazy. All I do is water it every few days. So after we harvested and did went through all that. So yes. We're sitting watching a movie and my wife turns to me, she goes, Is this a regular string? I said, well, yeah, but I let it go. And I walked down and said, why is that? She goes, this is really over the top. And I smoked it for a few days and I just, man, man, talk about, this is like the old joke about marijuana. Just completely dosed. No, no, no stimuli needed. Just sit and stare. I mean, yeah. When can I get my hands on a cut? Very shortly. I just Jeremy was kind of sent me a 315 watt light is going to give you the best results. And I appreciate your input. Okay, that's the only response you're going to get out of me. I don't think I know at all. I don't. I know two things. One, who invented horticulture lighting? Horst Schrager in Germany, which you would know as Hortilux, and a light company called PL Light Systems, okay, 1975. And it had nothing to do with cannabis. It had to do with extending the day period in a city that's pretty north, like Amsterdam, and they could extend the day period and do more food and flour production in greenhouses. So it was, they came on early in the morning. And then when the sun, after the sunrise, the light system would turn off. And then in the evening, they would come on at a certain point, you know, whatever the computer thing. And then that's how you extended your day period. Okay, nobody had at PL lights or hortilux thought that people are going to be doing them in concrete buildings, you know, in containers. Hey, look, when I first got started in the indoor thing, I can admit eighties. I really sinned. I used to use equal parts of perlite and vermiculite is my substrate for rooting. I mean, talk about garbage. I even bought into the whole B1 myth, which as we now know is a joke, a complete utter joke. It does nothing. Products like, what's that one? Oh, Super Thrive. Super Th with all that got like 1000 things written on it all over it sideways upside down crooked and yeah, 50 or 60 or 70 years whatever it was. They got one award one from the advertising Advertising Council of the American Horticulture Institute. In other words, they bought a lot of ads. Okay. And you know, notice how they always sell it at the counter in a in like a cardboard tote like on your way out. It's never with the, you know, like enzymatic products or anything like that. No, and they've been busted. If you look closely online, you'll find the formula and it ain't a big deal. You can make your own Supertribe. When he died, because he fought everybody and then he got delisted in several states. All right, because he refused to list the ingredients and after he died his daughter and family, other family members took over the company and they decided that, you know, he was a cool old man but enough's enough. He was a salesman, that's how he got started. You know, back in like the late 30s or early 40s or something, I mean, just a long time ago. And it was one of those joke products, you know, at a grocery store. Oh, well, you need some superchargers. That'll give you better clones. Oh, well, I want that. Yeah, so yeah, I remember when you went in a grocery store and there were only two product lines, Dyna-Gro and General Hydroponics. And then there was a powder out of Seattle called Eco-Gro. And where they brought to the party is they had three components. You had your grope, you had your flour, and then you had your micronutrients. The heavy seven is there, as they're called in the fertilizer industry, the big seven. They're all the always the same. The source may be different, but the seven are, you know, sulfur, copper, melendomum, boron. I mean, you get the idea. And they're always the same. And so these guys got a, they're all out of China, all this shit was. That's not a criticism, that's just how the industry got set up. And you bring it in, you rebadge it and put a cool label on it and you're dancing. I mean, you know, that's, it may be unpleasant to hear, but that's the industry. It's not guys in lab coats, burning Bunsen burners, you know, trying to decode, you know, the genetic structure of the next Hayes or something there, you know. Oh, it's, it's mobile salesman selling you snake oil and leaving town. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's like, yeah. Yeah. I, I used to go to grocery just to pick them up on, you know, their last leaders like smart pots or bows, you know, bows, you could always and I'd listen to like talking to a customer at the counter while I'm waiting my turn or something. I just think to myself, my God, this stuff flows like honey out of your mouth. I mean, he had like a hundred bucks worth of shit in a guy's cart. You remember in that scene from Animal House, the movie, okay, and they're in the grocery store and they start throwing boxes of food at the heavyset guy and he's trying to catch them all and he's falling back. It's because his arms are loaded with shit. Well that's what this scene looked like is that he had this kid scared to death about growing weed. Yeah and oh you're gonna need me to tell that and walk out and be your ph meter. You know I've never owned one. I've never used one. I don't care you know know, I don't. Oh, hey. Well then, so he can message the guy a week later and say, I need to pay you. My plants are wilty and something's wrong. Well, yeah, he threw a thousand salts at them and like expected them to grow. And so pay me your your money now because I'll be your consultant. Yeah that's why I want to be as a consultant. I mean I'm retired I had a good you know good time I wish everybody luck. I'll continue telling people how to save money to grow food or medicine or whatever they want to grow. But you got to try definitely. Clackamascoots.com. Clackamascoots.com. That's the new blog. We didn't even plug it. Oh, it's all right. That's got to be reworked. I got to talk to Jeremy about it. He's a computer guy but because I want there's some really serious stuff I want to post especially you know with all the disinformation and I mean I have a book that a man spent 35 years researching the neem tree. And he started out with a PhD. So Cologne University, pretty well known Institute in Germany. And there was a famine caused by locusts in West Africa. And he went down there as part of that there was this group of trees here and there that weren't affected by the locust whatsoever. And that was the neem tree. And that began at 35 years old. And that was the through Asia, Africa. And the name of the book is the neem tree. His last name is German and I'm not even going to try. It has more consonants than vowels. The website you told me a few days ago, what is it? Oh, neemresearch.ca, which is Canada. Yeah. Now that's the medical side of neem. There's nothing about gardening. There's nothing about pesticides, fungicides. This is about human and livestock health. And if you go to an India store and you start looking at what in the industry they call HAVA, health and beauty aids, and you look at the HAVA section, almost every shampoo, skin cream, toothpaste, you get the idea. It's gonna have neem in it. In fact, in the Ayurvedic, the Chinese have TCM, traditional Chinese medicine, India has Ayurvedic medicine. And in the Ayurvedic preparations, as they're called, over 72% contain some part of the neem, the root, the bark, the leaves, the kernel. Think of a olive tree. Both plants are droops. In olives, we consume the husk. And in the neem, we press the oil out of the kernel. If you ate the house, you wouldn't die but you wish you were. I mean, it's so bitter. I ate some neem meal just one time just to see, you know. And it was really heavy duty. So these are plants that are very integrated into the Indian culture. The name is one translation in the Erdi language means village pharmacy. And there are no name orchards, the seeds are gathered by the poor by tradition and by religion. And they take them to an aggregator who evaluates the product and then pays them. And then they segregated in the different levels because some are medicinal, some are gonna be used for external lotions and what have you. And then the meal is widely used in agriculture. I mean, this isn't like something that just happened. I didn't invent this. I mean, it has been used in neem for other reasons, for all kinds of reasons, or at least 4000 years years This isn't a new in fact when the big conglomerate They tried to take over the neem industry spent quotes this was in the 90s spent over 750 million dollars and went all the way to the Hague, the International Court at the Hague. And I believe it was WR Grace, but if I'm wrong, then I apologize. Not much, but you know, they're in for, I believe it was WR Grace and they were gonna try to control the knee. Why would they do that? Why would they spend $750 million to try to corner the knee market? And so India's complaint was that this was part of their tradition and brought in temple rubbings and photographs of images like Krishna riding on the chariot to the battle in the Baha'i Gita is using a bow and arrows made from the neem tree. It was said to be the strongest bow in all of India. So they were trying to steal their tradition and their culture, and they lost, lost big time. But you can find those documents under, not DEA, oh, FDA, US Agriculture, a lot of mean documents because W.R you know, like, take this and do something with it and use on a big scale is to this day pest and fungicides are the two biggest challenges facing food production. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, 10 years was it grace?? Yep, W.R. Grace. Yeah, in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It was quite a case. And the other woman who was involved in the movie Dirt, you get a chance to stream that from Apple, whatever streaming service uses Dirt, the movie. And it's the work of Dr. Shiva, who's got like a doctorate in physics. Yeah. So I want to bring her on because she makes a strong case against Biochar. That was what I was politely trying to explain before. I'm really conflicted. Not just because of her work, but others. I'll leave it at that. Her work in saving seeds and saving the culture of India is extraordinary. That movie Dirt, you'll be pleased and you'll be buying it for your art or library. It's a little nerdy, but it'll explain elements better than I can explain it or most others. Like, you know, we're drinking urine of Egyptians from 5,000 years ago. I mean, there's only so many elements there in this thing. And how they get rearranged is, well, that's a discussion that we should be having because it affects our food stocks or food supply. Those are kind of important questions. And I think the cannabis industry, look, I don't think I'm stating anything that isn't factual. Legalization hasn't been all that was hoped for by all kinds of parties. We can maybe agree on that. It could have gone off better. So maybe what the cannabis people, the ones that are serious like you guys, take it in another direction. We're going to teach you how to grow your legal plants. Depending on where you live, that may be defined by different things. But just even teaching people how to grow their food, that's what's going to be important, I believe. I mean, have you gone shopping lately and seen there's no food? I mean, Costco used to be like, you know, a bounty of everything, right? Now you're fighting over party wings? I don't know. We do eat party wings from Costco. They're wonderful. I didn't know that it was going to be as down to that or drumsticks, you know, in the chicken of our poultry. So I decided, you know, it was a good opportunity. I just decided to go, you know, vegetarian, not vegan. That's a little too out there for me. I mean, I want my cheese and God damn it. I need cream of my coffee. Yes. I agree strongly on both those points. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Okay. I'll leave it at that. I was in the food business, wholesale produce for many years. So I was in and around like how, you know, I would go down in the off season down around where Aaron's from and visit with our suppliers, because we were doing a million and a half a week in produce sales here in Portland. Independent grocers, school, you know, that kind of stuff, your contract stuff. And some chain stuff, but you know, whatever. And I just don't have a lot of confidence in Department of Agriculture at any level, state or federal. So I'm kind of like, I want to go to the farmers market with my mask. You know, I don't believe it's caused by 5g networks or was it? Let's see. I don't believe it's caused by 5G networks or, what is it? I don't know. It's fake news. Yeah, okay. Yeah, whatever. 5G networks. I was looking at my new GoPro. Okay, so you can set it up. We know, we can do a couple clicks here, a couple clicks there, and you set up in here. So your phone is connected to your GoPro. And so you can control the GoPro to some degree by using your phone. So that's all good and well, right? So I'm reading the details, and I don't want to blow anybody's bubble, but the network is 5G. So if you have a GoPro and you connect it to your Android or iPhone, you run the risk of coronavirus, according to the Wacos, the less than lucid. I'm still trying to figure out how something that broadcasts this, some kind of electric signal, right, how that controls biology. I'm not very bright. I did get through high school and then elsewhere. I mean, have we just turned into, we'll buy anything? I don't know. I was watching a YouTube video this morning, one of the stations out in Arizona, and they're gonna have to start making the decision to prioritizing who gets gets Basically who lives and who doesn't? It's that crazy so in other words if you're 32 a mother to you know single versus me to 69 Hey, it's nice knowing you, Jim. How about it? Okay. Yeah, I should just wear a DNR tag as soon as I walk in the hospital. Do not resuscitate, you know? Right. Anyway, in the politics, I just, you know, I can't believe that we're at where we're at. Well, and wave number two is hitting us. So now we have another like three months of this. So that's why everybody, we have plenty of time to do these shows. So one thing is funny is that since I did my thing and became an artisan baker so I can make my own bread, most of the stuff we get is very little canned. It's almost all fresh. So I got a fighting chance. And I take a Garakan mushrooms every day. Look that one at agar and then IKON. This won't blow your mind. This is a true antiviral mushroom. Goes back to the ancient Greeks. Holy shit, this thing's huge. Yeah, they live 100 years. Can you imagine that? Yeah, let me queue up the photo. Just give me one second. And I got a source for you too. Look at that. They're even bigger. I mean, they're giant. I've seen one that Paul Stamets was holding. That was like the size of a really huge beehive. I mean, a big one. You look like a bear holding it. It was really huge. This goes back to the ancient Greeks. This was a medicinal mushroom. Pretty cool. Yeah. So I assume that's not, that's something you have to look at. I mean, I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's something you have to forage, right? Right. And, uh, one company down in, uh, Southern Oregon near the California border called myriad mycology.com. They sell this powder. And they're growing their own. Because what you do is you take a sand, this is what I'm doing in mushroom growing. But anyway, you take a core of the inside there on the bottom of the gill, and then you put it in a Petri dish with agar and depending on sometimes wood agar even, and then you can grow it out and begin producing it. That's why like up there, I belong to two different mushroom groups, the Cascade mycology and North American mycology. And there's a lot of hobbyists. It's really cool. You go out in groups. You got a guide that knows their way around on which are medicinal, which are edible, what have you. And sometimes you get lucky one of the. One of the guys, he knows a philosophy varieties pretty well. She can get some, uh, Liberty caps or some of the other wonderful, this is the, you know, the Northwest because of the forest and all that. And the rain, this is like one of the epicenters of mycology in the world. Yeah. You don't grow a lot of mushrooms in Arizona. Or LA. Yeah, or LA, yeah. It's remarkable how much food is out there. Just waiting for it. There's chicken of the woods, not to be confused with hen the woods, which is known as my talkie. Very, very powerful medicinal mushroom easy to grow. You could even buy this at Santa market in LA, one of the food food markets, right? If they have a mushroom on sale, you could buy that and do not a lot of work. Take a clone of it for lack of a better phrase. And start growing it out on a Petri dish. And then eventually, yeah, if you're into science, you know, like stuff that's real kind of brainy. Mycology is where it's at. I'll tell you, there's so much neat shit going on. Yeah, well, we had, um, uh, hold on. Am, uh, ran that Mike Amaranthos on, uh, last week. Do you know who he is? He's down in Southern Oregon. He used to have a company called Myco applications. His focus, he was really well known in the world in the area of ecto micro isola as it relates to reforestation projects around the world. And then I met him at a trade show for the nursery sector here a few years ago. We had a long conversation and I was asking him about need. And he wasn't familiar with it, which was disappointing. Uh, but later I found it, talked to one of his associates professionally, uh, and got my questions answered on the name. Then I understand he passed away and his sons. No, no, he's still very alive. I was talking to him last week. His son now has a... He's carrying the family tradition. Oh, good. The first product I ever bought and used with any regularity was from Direct. There's a organic farm store in Portland area called Concentrates. They've been in business since 1938. Not in this form, but you get the idea. So this is where, okay, Tad Hussey's business. Kiss organics. He bought or that's it was his source. I you know, I told him about it. When they were first talking about setting it up. Jeremy Silva to build the soil. He started his business buying from concentrates that you know, changed over time. I mean, still does, but I'm just saying it wasn't the volume that it was different vendors and what have you. So I lucked on on one day, back in 2006, I guess. And it was like a kid in a candy store. They had everything. They had kelp meal, they had limestone, they had oyster shell powder. And I bought some stuff identified as worm castings. And were some of the compost that are popular up here that I, it's fun for me to denigrate, but I won't. Could be an advertiser. Why show restraint now? Okay, well, my favorite name for Oly Mountain is Oly Mountain compost or whatever it's called, is Oly Mountain mud. Usually where it's available, available at their big distributor here in Portland, it's been out in the rain. And I don't care what you bag it in. It rains up here. This is a rainforest. You know, I mean, you got to figure out where you're selling this stuff. You open up a bag and it's like you had to stand it on its edge with one inch tear in it so you can drain the water out. It's a problem that's consistent with all of this. I don't fuck with them. I just get a bale of sphagnum and call it a day. Oh, and the other thing I want to say about sphagnum, the brand does not matter one iota, not one. I'll give an example. One of the biggest harvester of sphagnum peat moss under CS, the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association. The biggest one is Sun Grow. You would know some of the brand names that they sell like Sunshine Mix, number one, number two, number three, number four. Their retail product is called Black Gold. Okay, so they're bigger than all their competitors combined. They harvest like 53% of all the sphagnum peat moss in Canada. And then your other big one is ProMix out of Montreal in Eastern Canada. Is that Burge? It could be. You can go to Canadian Spangman Piedmont Association and go to the members. There's less than 10. Yeah. I'll throw'll throw the picture up. But that's what we actually used. We used that two weeks ago to build some soil. You can keep going. I'll eventually get to it. I mean, there's all kinds of names, farfard, whatever you find that back in the Midwest, East coast. It breaks it down at that website, the Piedmont Association, you know, what provinces produced what volume on the West coast. All three of us are to be certification by that agency. And that agency is going to be certified by the agency. And that agency is going to be certified by the agency. And that agency is going to be certification by that agency. And that agency is a combination of government as well as industry. Yeah, anyway. That's not very relevant. I can't find a high resolution picture, so, that's right. Yeah. There's a number of names because they'll buy up former small companies that gave up the ghost and you buy it to prevent somebody else from getting it basically. And that's how SunGrow Horticulture got as big as they grabbed any opportunity they could. So but the name doesn't mean anything. In one case, I used to really think, Oh my God, this had nothing to do with the state. I don't know why I was named this was Alaskan Pete. Okay, and it came out of northern Alberta. And I'm at a trade show, and I'm talking to one of their competitors from up there. And I said, you know, this is so much better than the Sungrove bales, you know. So, shows me a picture on his tablet that the harvest area was less than 40 yards between the two mines, if you will. So the name doesn't mean anything, because all it is, don't even listen to a soil test because that's just a snapshot. It's not a guarantee. Unless you want to have it done before you accept delivery. You know. But there's nothing, because this stuff is not processed at all. Whereas peat moss is horribly, horribly, well just, they beat the shit out of it, they bake it, because you know, you're just gonna, trying to grow a 12 inch plant that goes in front of Home Depot in Arbovita. So, but long term, there's no benefit. A lot of people buy sphagnum peat moss and put it on top of their raised beds to control hydration and reduce evaporation, what have you. And because it adds microbial life, it's a live product. I don't know how much you have after you bake it at some incredible temperature for peat moss. Because they want it consistent. You already saw the videos on the robotics involved. So what you need is consistent product, right? Sizing and mesh or whatever you want to call it. So that's what has to be done because it's production. You go down to the big Sun Girl has a big packing house South of me about 15 miles. One of the bigger ones in the West 11 Western States. It runs 24 seven in a normal year. I can't tell you about now and when you walk because, because you can do the 25 cent tour, right? And look at the labels and you go, it's all packed in the same place. And I won't go any further than that. There's some other independent packers that handle the small people. You know, like, okay. I don't know, you know, like who cares? But you know, some things, a flash in the pan for a few months and they go away, right? So they have to go to contract backing houses. So if you go to talk to Sungrove, you know, they're talking 25 trucks. They're not going to, I need three pallets. Oh, okay. So you gotta go to the real hardcore independence and they charge accordingly. Figure it this way, each bag that you buy through, I don't care whether it's Home Depot or some retail store, a nursery, at least 450 of that was the bagging charge, at least. See if they could, they'd give you the soil if it were legal to. They'd give you the soil at Home Depot. Show you the plants and then, oh, well, you need a fertilizer. Oh, wait, you're going to need a fungicide. Oh, wait a minute. I'll buy a pesticide. So the time you walk out of there, you're what, chat. All right. How many people do we have? I think I can hear my one year old running around upstairs, so I want to go hang out with her. I see I have to I have to do growing with my fellow growers podcast at four and then I have to eat before that. I could listen to you talk literally infinitely. Well, so we'll do something again soon and we'll bring on some additional people with perspectives on various topics from fungi to whatever. Yeah, that was a... We need more experts just to fill how much Jim knows. We need a panel of experts to be like, expert, can you run with us a little further? What's that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. He was saying that we just need, we need experts to, to like, to further understand everything you know, sort of, as more of a segue between how much you know and how. Well, with a lot of these conversations, they go in all these different directions. So it's like you start doing a deep dive into some like, you know, root uptake of nutrient topic. And it's like, wait, they're like Cornell and UC Davis experts on that. And we have them on speed dial. Let's bring them into the conversation. One last thing before I go, just do this for yourselves. It's free. The book, What a Plant Kn, has a companion website, and also a few videos on YouTube. Just hit the website and get absorbed into the level of science here. And what Dr. Chenoweth, I believe is the name, is producing. I think it's one of the top, in the top five books of every gardener and grower should have. And because if you listen to the din at Canicon and the rest, all you need is some magic solution that's going to increase your fining or linoleum levels or something. And it's just, it's horrible. You'll love this book. I'd come back on and just to discuss, yep, that's it. I've come back on just to discuss that book. By the time you get to it. Ordering my copy. I was going to say, I'll email Daniel Chemevitz. Great man. Great man. Check out his videos. Give him a thumbs up. I mean, they're really serious interviews. He's not trying to sell anything. I mean, look at his resume where he went to school and wasn't here in Clackamas County. I can promise you that. All right, gentlemen, thank you very much. Sorry, let me. And with that, I will kill the live stream, So how many people are still let's see what five hours and 20 minutes into the conversation we have still 235 people. So thank you, everybody. Jim, you are a trooper. I think next time we need to get a we need to have you feel less reserved Yeah, you gotta see me back in the days my drink I was gonna say we get some alcohol on to you and yeah, I had Yeah, I kicked diabetes with Chinese mushrooms. I just stopped everything one day. Saved about 1500 a month. Even with Medicare or whatever. All right. Well, anyway, guys, have a good one. With that, I will kill the live stream. Thank you to the audience. And we will see you possibly even tomorrow or later today. See you, everyone.", "id": "64ab641b-62a0-4e8e-ba42-505e74b01f7c"}

Here's a breakdown:\n**1. Entry into the Plant:**\n* **Roots:** Calcium enters the plant primarily through the roots. It's absorbed from the soil solution, often aided by **calcium channels** in the root cells. \n* **Active Transport:**  Calcium needs energy to move into the plant against its concentration gradient, so this process is **active**. It requires specialized **calcium pumps** in the root cell membranes that use ATP (cellular energy) to transport calcium into the cell.\n**2. Movement within the Plant:**\n* **Xylem:**  Once inside the root cells, calcium travels through the plant via the **xylem**, a network of vascular tissue that transports water and nutrients upwards.\n* **Passive Diffusion:**  Movement within the xylem is largely **passive**, meaning it relies on the flow of water upwards. As water moves upwards, it carries dissolved calcium along with it.\n*  **Limited Mobility:** Calcium has relatively **limited mobility** within the plant compared to other nutrients like potassium or nitrogen. It tends to stay in the cell where it was initially absorbed, contributing to its structural role.\n **3. Reaching its Destination:**\n* **Specific Needs:**  Calcium is transported to different parts of the plant depending on their needs. For example:\n*  * **Cell Walls:** Calcium is crucial for cell wall structure and integrity, so it will be transported to actively growing areas like new leaves and shoots.\n*  * **Shoots:**  Calcium is also transported to shoots for various functions, including signaling and regulating plant growth.\n*  * **Fruits:**  Developing fruits require calcium for proper development and firmness.\n **4. Regulation and Control:**\\\n* **Cytoplasmic Calcium:** The concentration of calcium within the cytoplasm of cells is tightly regulated by internal mechanisms that control calcium transport and storage.\n* **Signaling Role:** Calcium plays a key role in cellular signaling processes, acting as a second messenger to activate various biochemical pathways in response to environmental cues or stress.\n\n**In summary:** Calcium's journey within a plant involves a combination of active transport at the root level, passive movement through the xylem, and careful regulation to ensure its distribution meets the plant's specific needs. This essential nutrient plays a vital role in plant growth, development, and overall health.", "id": "4ec7db3e-02c5-456b-aad1-935074fa0f20"}

Chemical fertilizers offer immediate nutrient availability and flexibility in addressing deficiencies, while organic methods improve soil quality over time and are more sustainable. From the plant's perspective, nutrients are the same regardless of source, but the processes and impacts on soil health differ significantly between the two approaches. For example, chemical fertilizers allow for growing in challenging conditions or small containers, while organic cultivation requires larger soil volumes and more careful management of heavy metals. A hybrid method involves using organic media as a base while incorporating small amounts of mineral salts to provide plants with readily available nutrients when needed. While not certified organic, this approach potentially offers the best of both worlds for maximizing plant growth and yield. The hybrid method is often used by growers aiming to produce exceptionally large plants, such as giant pumpkin cultivators. It provides more flexibility and a wider range of tools for addressing plant needs, potentially resulting in bigger plants and higher yields compared to strictly organic or chemical methods alone.", "id": "7aec730a-6892-4c39-b52e-fcc40b7d6eb4"}

So first and foremost, I want to say that seeds contain all the nutrients that they need to germinate and initially grow.  Once they get a little bit larger, they're gonna need fertility,  but you don't really want a lot of fertility in your seed starter mix.  One nice thing about seed starter is  there's a lot of good options out there if you don't want to make your own.  You can use Jiffy Pots, you can use  commercially made seed starter mixes, and you can find ones, you know, even the ones at Home Depot would work.  This is our seed starter mix.  What we use is a combination of peat moss,  coco coir, vermiculite,  and a little bit of calcium and organic fertilizer. And that's a good  general seed starter  recipe to follow, and I'll give you more details here in a moment.  But one of the things that we want to think about when  considering a seed starter mix is we want something that's gonna have very good gas exchange,  very good water holding capacity, and allow for us to also  retain a lot of moisture. So when we go to water, we want a mix that's going to allow for good root growth and  here's one that I watered recently, and you can see the roots of these corn are coming out the bottom.  And also it's not gonna have large aeration.  See how it's small here? Because large aeration is actually gonna prevent, could prevent or restrict germination.  So by comparison in our  regular soil mixes, we use a combination of medium and large pumice.  This is just way too large to fit into these smaller cell trays.  So you want to be using a fine vermiculite or fine perlite in your seed starter mix.  In general,  levels of aeration would be higher. So in a living soil, you know, something like our mix over here,  we're using approximately 33-34% aeration.  That's a combination of 2 thirds medium, 1 third large pumice. Now with our seed starter mix,\n\n2:07 - 4:15\n we're gonna be closer to 40 to 50 percent aeration of whether that's the fine perlite or vermiculite.  And then the rest of that's gonna be either peat moss or coca-cora.  Now do you want to use earthworm castings or compost in your seed starter mix?  And this is a little bit of a complicated question and you just need to be thoughtful in your decision here. So  there are benefits to using earthworm castings or using high quality compost in your seed starter mix.  The advantage there is you're gonna get more beneficial biology, better nutrient cycling.  It's gonna provide some levels of nutrients as well and also help with the overall tilt of your seed starter mix.  The disadvantages are that compost could also be bringing in biology that you don't want. Pathogens like  things that cause damping off and other  fungal pathogens as well as fungus gnats, which are  annoying and if they get out of control populations get too high, they will start eating plant roots. So  that's just a decision that everyone kind of has to make on their own. A lot of people are very successful  adding, you know, 10 to 15 percent compost. Some people go as high as 50 percent compost, which I typically don't recommend.  But you can do it successfully.  So you're gonna want to experiment with what makes sense in your mix just being aware of those risks associated with using  compost or earthworm castings.  So beyond that, getting back to our formulation, you're looking at let's say  40 to 50 percent perlite.  That other  50 to 60 percent would be made up of a combination of peat moss,  coccocore, or maybe a tiny amount of compost in the 10 to 15 percent range.  Once you have a mix that you like in that regard, you test it out, it holds water,  it does well, then you're going to add a little bit of  agricultural lime or oyster shell or rilacinite to raise the pH of that into a range that's appropriate.  Somewhere between 6-4 to 7 is a good pH range for your seed starter mix.\n\n4:15 - 6:25\n And you're gonna have to experiment a little bit with that to hit the range that you want depending on the ratios of  those other inputs. If you're using just coccocore, so your soil is already going to be relatively neutral,  then you're gonna forgo any agricultural lime, oyster shell, or rilacinite and just use gypsum. And  with the gypsum, I would personally in a  cubic foot of soil, I would go as high as a cup of gypsum, which is a fairly aggressive rate,  but because of the solubility of gypsum, you can get away with that. And  that would just ensure that you're gonna have adequate calcium for your plant during its initial life stage.  If I was using a combination of peat moss and  my pH was low and I raised it up using eggs,  agricultural lime, oyster shell, things like that, then I might drop that rate down to say a third of a cup to half a cup of gypsum per cubic foot.  As far as other ingredients to add,  people use a wide variety of things ranging from kelp meal, alfalfa meal, even just a  starter fertilizer or organic fertilizer. If it's below, let's say 4-4-4 in terms of NPK value,  you could cut the application rates in half and probably half to a quarter and probably safely add it to your seed starter mix.  Otherwise, what you're doing is once the plant gets established like this, when you go to transplant,  so this one I started in a cell and transplant into a larger pot, I went into our higher fertility soil with that transplant,  that's when you can add more nutrients after the plant's established. So you don't really need a lot  for these initial stages.  The only other consideration that I wanted to show you is  be aware if you're using peat moss, that  seed starter mix, and our seed starter mix would be guilty of this as well,  it can be hydrophobic.  So what happens with that is it doesn't want to accept water and you'll have to use a surfactant  or maybe a saponin as a way of making the water wetter essentially.\n\n6:25 - 7:44\n Even just a drop of dish soap will help with that. Now if you don't choose to use that,  which I don't always have something on hand or choose to add something,  what I'll do is I'll just water more slowly or use sub irrigated watering as a technique to make sure the pots getting wet.  Now what can happen is you go to water and this looks wet and in this case it really is wet,  but what can happen is you can dig under here a little bit and you'll see that it's actually  bone dry. That water that you think is getting soaked up in there is  literally just rushing through to the bottom and that's where sub irrigated watering really comes in handy because you can have a tray,  a tray like this where it's two trays and one tray will have  holes in it and the other tray will not and by filling up the water in the tray or by when you water  and you over water that water will sit in the tray. You don't want the water like super high,  but if it's just a little bit in the bottom there that will wick up slowly over time and make sure that the  soil actually gets wet.  So those are just some pointers in regards to seed starting mixes and  formulations. In this case, you can see this one cell dried out,  so I'll be watering just this one today because everything else in here is really wet.  But I hope I hope that answers questions about seed starter formulations.", "id": "035cf70f-6ba8-49ac-bec7-134fc09cf0e4"}

So, sorry. Yeah, no problem. So, we had our first  snowfall last night, but that doesn't change the topic of what  I'm going to speak about. What I want to present to you is the  updated soil food web. This is a talk that basically goes  through the science behind organic gardening, and at the end  of an hour, you're going to know everything you need to know to  be a fabulous organic gardener and reasons why you would not  want to be a chemical gardener. But in any case, I call it the  updated soil food web. Let's see if I can get this to work.  With all the practice we had in COVID, I guess I got to put  play. Yeah, that might make some sense.  All right, there we go. Now I have to do an adjustment. It's  crazy. I don't know if you can see that. I am the author of  let me just get this. I'm sorry about this, folks. Again, with  all the practice we had during COVID, you'd think once it's  over, we'd get it right. Okay, so I am the author of the team  with microbe series. And as a result, I had a trilogy, and I  called myself Lord of the roots because I thought that was kind  of funny. And then these are the books in the trilogy. She is  doing it again. I can fix that. Sorry, folks. So the trilogy, it  turns out, was not enough because we did have COVID and I  had nothing else to do. So I wrote a fourth book, and I wrote  a quadrilogy. And the books basically deal with the fact that  plants produce exudates, things that drip out of the root system\n\n\n```timestamp\n2:03\n```\n by using their photosynthetic energy and by putting together  the nutrients that it obtains from the soil. And these are the  exudates, a great picture of the exudates. And these exudates  attract microbes. And these microbes are what run our  gardening system. Now, you know, I could talk about it using  this slide, but it's a little understandable. So let me go  this way, make it a little bit more understandable. About 50%  or so of the photosynthetic energy of a plant is used to  produce things that drip out of the roots. You're sweating,  your sweat is the exact same thing. It's an exudate. These  exudates drip out of the roots, and they're designed by the  plant to attract bacteria and fungi, because the bacteria and  fungi don't produce their own carbon. They love these  exudates because these exudates are full of carbon. So they're  right there next to the roots in what's known as the rhizosphere,  and they're eating away having a great time. And then along  comes their predators, nematodes and protozoa. And the nematodes  and protozoa eat the fungi and the bacteria, because they also  need carbon, and there is carbon contained now in those  fungi and bacteria as a result of eating the exudates. And the  nematodes and protozoa devour these fungi and bacteria. And  then they excrete the excess that they don't need. And what  they excrete turns out to be plant usable nutrients. They  break down the fungi and bacteria into nutrients that are  usable by the plant. They actually have an electrical  charge put on them so that they can go into the plant. And\n\n\n```timestamp\n4:00\n```\n that's basically the soil food web that we learned in 2006. It  was popularized by a woman named Dr. Elaine Ingham. But even  that's a little too confusing. So let me show it this way. And  then of course, you've got the little guys, the nematodes and  the protozoa get eaten by bigger guys all the way on off the  chain. So let's look at it this way. There's a bunch of trees.  It's a Friday afternoon. This is Fox Island. And these trees  are sitting around talking to each other through the Worldwide  Web. And one of them says, let's have some Japanese food  tonight. And a little or one says, we did that last week. This  is a Mexican. And the third one says, no, no, no, let's have  French, but the big tree wins. And so they're going to have  Japanese food. These are the roots of those trees. Let me put  them in root position. And all that they have to do in order to  get the Japanese food is produce an exudate that they  drip out into the into the soil right there in the rhizosphere.  And they attract the Japanese fungi and bacteria that they  that they are going for. Now, if one of the plants had said  American food, and they decided to have American food, they  would change the exudate. The plants are capable of changing  the exudates and dripping them out and attracting American  food. So they can change the exudates in order to obtain  nutrients and results that they need. This is this is an  amazing thing because we look at plants, they can't walk, they  can't run away. They can't gather things, but they can  produce these exudates, which do all sorts of things for the  plant right there in the soil. So this is the soil food web  that we learned back in the very early days. This is the  basis of teaming with microbes. My first book, which has been  translated now into 10 languages, not because it's a\n\n\n```timestamp\n5:56\n```\n great book, but because this is how we learned that the plant  feeds itself, not through Miracle Grow, you know, not  through Peters, but through their own natural system. And  it got the name micro mediated, cellularization of soil  nutrients 2006. So this is teaming with with bacteria.  And it's again, a very simple system. The little guys get  eaten by the bigger guys. And there's all sorts of of  consumption and decay. And you end up getting nutrients, which  go into the soil and go into the plants. It's a very simple  system. All right. So then several years later, it became  very clear that we needed to amend that view because there  was something else going on involving those fungi. So it  was called mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis. Now, you remember  those bacteria and those fungi that are attracted by those  exudates? Well, some of the fungi don't get eaten. Instead,  they get called by the plant, the plant sends out a signal  and they enter into the plant and they move between the cells  of the plant and they transfer nutrients which they obtain  from the soil into the plant in return for the exudates that  they get. So this is a picture of mycorrhizal fungi  entering into a root and getting in into the insides. And  it's just a fascinating thing. And it turns out that about 90%  of plants form this symbiotic relationship. And we've known  about it since the 1890s, but we were never able to really\n\n\n```timestamp\n7:54\n```\n duplicate the fungi. And so it had no commercial application.  And if there's no commercial application, scientific  research often slows down to a standstill. This is a picture of  one of the seven different kinds. This is an important kind  that associates with your trees and around all your tree roots  are these hyphal sheets, these fungal hyphal sheets. And then  some of these fungal go inside and they form structures in  between the plant root cells. And they're very elegant. Now,  they've been very studied. There are some 300 or so different  kinds were capable of making eight to 16 of them. I don't  can't remember what the exact number is, but they sleep  around. And so one particular type of mycorrhizal fungi will  infect, and that's the right word, many different kinds of  plants. This is the kind that does the again, the trees. And  then this is sort of a depiction of what is really going on. You  have all of these wonderful small mycorrhizal fungi that are  able to go out into the soil in an area where the plants root  itself can't reach because it's too big. And they collect  phosphorus and water. These are the things that they bring  back and they bring it back to the plant. And the plant says,  thank you very much. Here's some exudate. Go back and get me  more. And they have this wonderful symbiotic relationship.  And it's a good thing they do because again, the root itself  goes into the soil, but it forms a depletion zone. And so by  having these mycorrhizal fungi go out into the soil, it  extends the reach of the root itself, which is an important  thing, obviously, because you don't want plants growing in a\n\n\n```timestamp\n9:53\n```\n depletion zone because there are only other choices to just  simply grow down deeper and leaving all these great  nutrients there. All right, so this is how a mycorrhizal fungi  works if you don't have a telescope to watch it. So you've  got a bunch of seedlings, two of them sitting out in the sun,  again, Fox Island. And one of them says, gee, I would really  like a bologna sandwich. And so what does it do? Well, it  mixes up the right exudates. It puts those exudates out into  the soil, and it attracts the kind of fungi that it needs to  make a bologna sandwich, which it does, and it delivers it to  the seedling. The seedling now has established this  relationship. The relationship continues, and the seedling  grows as a result of the work that the mycorrhizal fungi is  doing in return for getting those exudates. So this is a  very important addition to the basic 2006 soil food web  picture. And these mycorrhizal fungi do some really fun things.  They can associate with an individual plant, or they can  associate with more than one plant and form that web. It's  not quite the worldwide web that's been described in the  news, but you do get sharing between individual mycorrhizal  fungi and different plants. All right, so that was about 2010.  That was called mycorrhizal fungal symbiosis. And then we  started to learn about something known as endophytic bacterial  symbiosis. And this is the basis of my fourth book. This would  be the second book I would read, incidentally, after  Teeming with Microbes, if you were reading the series, because  it's such an important new addition to the way the soil\n\n\n```timestamp\n11:52\n```\n food web works. So let's get into that. It's called endophytic,  meaning inside endophytic plant, inside the plant, bacterial  symbiosis. And it features something known as rhizophagy,  root eating, a discovery that was made back in 2010 in  Australia by a bunch of scientists working at the  university, Southern University, I think it was. And what they  discovered was that there were bacteria just inside plant  roots, which they thought occurred as a result of plant  root cells engulfing these bacteria. And they called that  rhizophagy. And unfortunately, they ran out of they called it  rhizophagy or something of that sort, because they had an  Australian accent, but I call it rhizophagy. And unfortunately,  they ran out of funding. And so the whole concept just sort of  languished until 2018, when scientists at Rutgers University  picked up this discovery and using new kinds of  microscopes really figured out what was going on. And it is a  whopper. So let's go into it. So again, some of those fungi  don't get eaten. They form the mycorrhizal fungus that are  attracted by the exonates and some of those bacteria, they  also don't get eaten. They form what's known as the rhizophagy  cycle. So I want to first point out that bacteria incredibly  small, this is the proverbial pin. And there are the bacteria  on the tip of the pin. So they're incredibly small,\n\n\n```timestamp\n13:52\n```\n they're everywhere, they multiply every 20 minutes. They're  fascinating. And we don't we don't really study enough, we  study dinosaurs, we don't study things like microbes that are  important. But these are really incredible. So I want you to  keep this picture in mind as we go through some of these next  slides. So the bacteria are attracted by that exudate. And  here are some bacteria, bunches of bacteria that are attracted  to the root tip of a plant. And they're there and they're  devouring up the exudates. Now a lot of these are going to get  eaten by nematodes and protozoa. But this is before that has  occurred. And what happens is they form a bacterial slime.  When you have a bunch of bacteria, they form a slime in  order to be able to hide from their predators and in order to  be able to trap food sources. And so that's why you brush your  teeth in the morning, they have a slime on it, you have to use  energy in order to remove that slime. And it's a real  protective layer. These certain bacteria, these razzophagy  bacteria are living in the slime with a bunch of other  bacteria, some of which are going to get eaten. And they  smell something very familiar, they smell a popcorn smell. And  this popcorn smell indicates to them that there is a empty slime  facility right next door, and they should go live there,  because there won't be so much competition. And so they move  into that new slime area attracted by this smell, only if  there isn't a slime area, what they end up doing is breaking  through these very thin walls at the tip of roots, very, very  thin walls, and they break through it thinking they're\n\n\n```timestamp\n15:51\n```\n going into a new slime colony. And they break through these  cell walls, and they end up in a particular spot in the cell  that's known as the paraplasmic space. Now I'm throwing a lot  of science at you. So again, I try to make it easy. The  paraplasmic space is this little space between well, let me make  it really easy. This is the cell wall, this is the guts of the  cell. And there's this little area around here. The easiest  thing to think of is tofu. This is the cell wall. This is the  guts of the cell, and there's the water all the way around  there. That's the paraplasmic space. And these bacteria back  through, they smell that popcorn smell, they're attracted  again by the plant itself, just like the mycorrhizal fungi are,  and they back into this paraplasmic space where they find  themselves. And in the paraplasmic space, they can, they  live, and they multiply, because every 20 minutes they multiply,  so after 20 minutes of being in there, they're doubling their  numbers, and they're cycled. There's a little cyclosis going  around inside the cell that moves stuff around, and this  moves as well. And so here you can see, here's another picture,  different kind of bacteria, different kind of plant cell, but  these are those endophytic rhizophagy bacteria. All right,  so they're inside there, and when they get in there, the  plant goes, hmm, I don't really, I got to be careful. I don't  want these guys to take over and kill me. And so the plant  sprays the bacteria with something known as a ROS, a  reactive oxygen series. ROS is quite simply what causes sunburn.  When you get sunburned, it's because your cells are producing  a ROS to protect themselves from the UV rays. Well, they produce\n\n\n```timestamp\n17:53\n```\n a ROS to protect themselves from these bacteria. And in fact,  I even found a ROS with a sunburn just so that we could tie  everything together. All right, anyway, this ROS has the effect  of stripping off the bacteria's cell wall, and so the bacteria  end up without cell walls, and the plant cell absorbs the  nutrients that were the bacterial cell wall and use them  to grow, which is a pretty amazing thing. Now, the bacteria,  as you can imagine, they don't like to get sprayed, and it does  a couple of things. It stresses them out, but by the same token  I should add, it also stresses out the plant. And if the plant's  not careful and sprays the wrong or the too higher  concentration of ROS, it hurts itself. And so by spraying the  ROS on the bacteria, it has to strengthen its own cell. And so  the plant becomes stronger as a result of these bacteria. And so  they get this induced stress resistance, which lives throughout  the plant for the rest of the plant's life that makes the plant  stronger. Now, it also turns out that the bacteria don't like it,  and so they do two things. The first thing they do is they  produce ethylene. Ethylene causes the plant cell, it's a  phytohormone, and it causes the plant cell to stretch. And then  they also produce nitrate. So the ethylene and the nitrate  react and weaken the ROS. They produce different things that  weaken the ROS so that even though they've lost their cell  walls, they're not going to get killed by continued application.\n\n\n```timestamp\n19:51\n```\n So it weakens the ROS, and these wall-less bacteria continue  to cycle in that periplasmic space, and they continue to  multiply as they produce this stuff. The cell is stretched,  and they take a little bit of carbon, these bacteria, and they  form a cycle, which is very, very important in order for the  bacteria to keep alive, and in order for the plant to keep alive,  these cycles form, and the cell continues to stretch, the  bacteria continue to multiply, and they produce their ethylene,  and the protection that they produce is actually nitrous. They  take nitrogen from the air, now they're inside the plant, and  they fix that nitrogen to form nitric oxide, which also weakens  the ROS. So they got this ethylene and this nitrous oxide  weakening the ROS. What they're doing is they're fixing nitrogen  inside the plant cell, just like rhizobia bacteria do, but this  is completely different. This is inside the plant cell, and it  turns out that if the Raza-Fasi cycle is going on, up to 40% of  the nitrogen that a plant uses, I'm going to repeat that, 40% of  the nitrogen that a plant uses comes from this internal nitrogen  fixation, which we had no idea was going on before 2018. So if  you haven't ever heard of this before, it's because no one has.  In fact, I would say you're probably a group of 4,000 people  who may know about Raza-Fasi, but everybody's going to learn  about it. So what you've got, again, this is the depiction, this  is the paraplasmic space, the bacteria are moving around, and\n\n\n```timestamp\n21:53\n```\n they're being cycled around, and inside the paraplasmic space is  a membrane and all the goodies that are inside the chloroplasts  and all that kind of stuff. But we're interested in this area  right here, and you continue to get growth as these bacteria are  cycled around, multiplying, and again, they're very, very, very  small, and they multiply and they begin to form structures like  this. This is a multiplied wall-less bacteria, and they're  all throughout the thing, and then they begin to form like this.  They begin to conglomerate. You get more and more of them because  you continue to get this multiplication, and they begin to  clog up the pathway, so to speak, and back up against the wall of  the cell, and when they back up against the wall of the cell, the  ethylene concentrates against that wall and forms a tube, and these  are the tubes that are being formed off of the main cell of a  root tip. If you look carefully here, you can see this is with the  tube. See the tube being formed, and it's there. You see a little  bit of the tube here. It's not a brand new cell. It's part of this  cell right here. It's this little hair that grows out of the root.  Wait a minute. It is. It's a root hair. So here's a shocker, folks.  Every single root hair you've ever seen has bacteria in it. Why do I  know that? Because the bacteria are what cause root hairs. We were  all brought up to believe that root hairs grow so that the plant can  get nutrients. They go out into the soil, blah, blah, blah. Well,\n\n\n```timestamp\n23:52\n```\n that's not true. They grow because they're putting these bacteria  into them. They're getting bacteria filled. They happen to be very thin  walled, and I did a tremendous amount of study, again, because it was  COVID and because I had the ability to be able to do it. These are very  thin wall structures, and they open up. So there's no wonder that if  you read Teaming with Nutrients, one of the other books I wrote, which  talks about how plants take nutrients in, the nutrients are able to move  through these incredibly thin walls. And so they do take up nutrients,  but they are formed by bacteria for a completely different purpose,  because what happens is they continue to multiply as they move into these  cells. So they're in the cells and they begin to multiply and they get  clombered up at the tip. And this blue indicates that there's nitrogen  being produced from these little guys. That's the dye. And then all of a  sudden, they are blown out of the tip of that growing tube, which we call  a root here. And they go back out into the soil, and here they are  conglomerating in the tip, and boom, out they go. And here they are, blown  out into the soil. These are wall-less bacteria, so are these, and they grow  back their cell wall, and in two or three days, they move back into a new  root cell and form new root hairs. And it doesn't happen just once. As that  root hair grows, you get explosion after explosion after explosion, and then  they go back into the soil and they grow back their cell wall. This is\n\n\n```timestamp\n25:50\n```\n clearly amazing stuff to most people. They work, they eat, they travel, they  repeat, they go back. It's an incredible system. It's now called the  erasophagy cycle. It has been observed, obviously, in many different ways. If  you remove the bacteria, you do not get root hairs. Wow, unbelievable. So what  we used to think is that the plant, by producing the exudates and putting the  exudates out into the soil, was sort of farming. And then it would gather  in in the fall, it would bring in all the nutrients, and that was it. But what  we're learning is they also are herding. So they're ranchers as well as farmers,  and they go out and they bring these bacteria in, they shear off the walls,  they eat an occasional leg of lamb, and then they put them back out into the  paddock to grow back the wall again. It's absolutely an unbelievable thing. It's  known as erasophagy. You may not have ever heard of it. You will hear lots  about it because it turns out that it's a very useful research tool and  potentially an unbelievable substitute for actual chemical fertilizers. So  that's what the world's been looking for for a long time. Now, those erasophagy  bacteria that move in are endophytic bacteria. And as these roots begin to  grow, you end up with little cracks in the main root itself. And because  bacteria are everywhere, and because bacteria are always looking for an  advantage over other bacteria so that they can go to a place where they can\n\n\n```timestamp\n27:46\n```\n breed without predators and where they can eat without competition, there is a  bunch of bacteria that would have been eaten perhaps by nematodes and protozoa  that sneak in the cracks that form when these root hairs form as well. And so  they sneak in. They're very, very small. And then they're capable of moving  throughout the plant in the phylum or the xylem and even in the  athoplasic pathways in between cells. And so you end up with endophytic bacteria  throughout the root and they move into the plant itself. Some move in through  stomata, but most of them come in through the root system. And some of them end up  in the flower. And as the flower is forming seeds, they get trapped in the seed.  And they're inside the seed so that when the seed is planted in new soil,  the seed brings with it the kinds of bacteria that it needs in order to grow  properly. Again, an unbelievable discovery. There are corn plants, species that are  400 years old. And if you plant one today, it has the same bacterial mix or very  close bacterial mix to what it had 400 years ago because it carries its seeds.  This is probably where terroir comes from. Not the soil, but the microbes that are  in the plant that come from the soil and get passed on. It's an amazing thing  while we're studying. And so again, you get the bacteria, they get trapped. When  the plant germinates, the bacteria move into the soil. Some of them end up as  rhizophasic bacteria. Some of them end up as endophytic bacteria. And it's a\n\n\n```timestamp\n29:51\n```\n beautiful, beautiful system. These bacteria, these endophytic bacteria are capable of  producing hormones. And so they produce the key hormones that you need for plant  growth. Now the plants obviously can produce these as well. But when they get assisted by  these bacteria, it's a wonderful thing. And why would a bacteria do this? It would  produce these things inside a plant because it's tricking the plant into allowing it to live  inside the plant. So the plant says, oh yeah, I get some oxygen out of this. Well, gee, I get some  ethylene out of this. And I'll let these guys stay here. And the bacteria gets to live without  the competition. It gets a source of food without competition. And everybody lives happily ever  after. So you end up with all sorts of things as a result of these bacteria. The stress that's  created causes some wonderful things to happen. This induces systemic resistance, but you also  get all of these things occurring as well as a result of these bacteria moving in. And I might  add some fungus, particularly yeast, do the same thing. They're not micro-organic. They're  not mycorrhizal. They act like these bacteria and they go through an endophytic phase of their life.  And these endophytic bacteria help plants to deal with abiotic stress. They can lower the freezing  point of water or raise the freezing point of water. They can help a plant deal with salt,  or with flooding, with drought. They can help plants deal with pathogens that are attacking them.  The plant can selectively allow in a bacteria that's able to take out some of its pathogens.\n\n\n```timestamp\n31:51\n```\n It's a wonderful, terrific defense system. If you can get the bacteria to do your fighting for you,  all you give up is a little bit of space and maybe a little bit of carbon.  Some of these bacteria are capable of doing things like cleating iron. They'll enter into  a plant root. They'll live inside the plant. And when the plant has either got too much iron  or doesn't have enough iron, they can hop out into the soil where they can gather up all the iron  together or arsenic together so that it doesn't go in and poison the plant.  So they do all sorts of wonderful things. There are, Tad and I were talking, just the beginnings  of endophytic bacteria that are producible and are available. These top ones up here  are things that you can get at cannabis growth stores. They're beginning to use them.  This one fixes nitrogen. There's different kinds depending on what areas you live in. There's one  from Brazil and Russia, et cetera, et cetera. This one is one that people are beginning to look at.  These can be stored relatively easy. This requires freeze drying so people are trying to figure out  how to use these things. But what big industry has discovered is that it's possible to find and to  isolate endophytic bacteria that do things to your plant that you need them to do. So for example,  if you're growing a tomato and you end up with powdery mildew all the time on that, if research  has it proper, they're going to find the right bacterium to put into the soil so that it goes  into the plant and fights off that powdery mildew so that you don't end up getting that problem.  They're not doing it for me and you. They're doing it for the big guys, but it'll come down\n\n\n```timestamp\n33:54\n```\n to our level, no question about it. These three are already getting close to our level. Just as  rhizobia bacteria have come down to our level, you can find rhizobia bacteria and nitrogen-fixing  bacteria wherever you buy legumes as an inoculant for your peas and other legumes.  So the really obvious takeaway, plants really are in control. Whether you go by the original soil  food web or you move all the way through to the modern view of the soil food web, which includes  the rhizophagy, they're in control. And we like to think we're in control, but when we think that,  we end up taking actions that are not necessarily in the soil food web's best interest. We interfere  with the way the soil food web works and we end up having to do a lot of work ourselves as a result  of taking away the ability of these invisible microbes to do the workforce. So plants are  definitely in control and they're amazing, which is really the most amazing takeaway.  They do things we just completely had no idea that they were doing. We keep getting better and  microscopy and staining and as a result, we're beginning to see what plants can actually do.  This is where I usually pop in and say, we've got to stop teaching our kids about dinosaurs, useless.  We need to start teaching our kids about microbes because they impact everything we do. And they're  beautiful. They're absolutely stunning and gorgeous. We can make them every bit as interesting as  the Tyrosonus Rex and all that kind of stuff. It's amazing to me that a four or five-year-old kid  knows all the dinosaurs, knows even how to spell some of these incredibly complicated words I  can't even say, and yet has no idea what a bacteria is. Chemicals obviously have a negative effect on\n\n\n```timestamp\n35:53\n```\n endophytic bacteria. They fill things out of balance, so you've got to be very careful how  you use it. You've got to use the best practices possible. All of the things that keep a soil food  web alive also help the Razofezzi cycle and endophytic bacteria. Mulches, leaving leaves alone,  using compost, even compost teas, compost extracts. These are all things that help the soil food web  are considered to be best practices. No rototilling, which breaks everything up  and destroys the soil food web or at least impacts the soil food web so that has to  rebuild itself and you lose that time. All of these things are important. You have to feed the  soil. The soil is everything. You can test things. My favorite test these days is something called a  microbiometer. Yes, you need to have an NPK test every now and then so you know what your soils  have in it and what they're capable of doing, but you need to know whether what you're doing is helping  the soil food web or whether it's hurting it. Go look at www.microbiometer.com. It's this really  cool test. You use your cell phone and you can tell whether you're increasing or decreasing  the biomass, the bacterial and fungal biomass. If it increases, you're doing good and if it  decreases as a result of what you're doing, you're doing something wrong.  And don't disturb the soil. Prevent compaction. No tilling. Be careful. Your soil is the most  valuable thing we have. Don't sterilize seeds. That's a silly thing to do and don't necessarily  use sterile soil either. Those seeds contain the bacteria that your plant needs in order to live.  When they germinate, you want to have them be able to do so. Use mulches. They provide organic  material which all of the soil food web needs. Don't rototilt. Don't toss. Use soil. Reuse it.\n\n\n```timestamp\n37:55\n```\n It contains exudates. It contains bacteria. It contains organic material and compost,  compost, compost. Beautiful stuff. Use it all the time. Make compost out of the same plants  you're growing. It contains a lot of the goodies that your plants used and would use again.  And test your compost. Some plants, because compost has different kinds of bacteria in it,  like vermicompost and some plants like thermal compost more. Which ones? I don't know. We've  got to do the research and this is a home scientific experiment. But you're going to  find that your broccoli is going to do better in one kind of compost versus the other because the  bacterial composition is different and you'll get different endophytic bacteria along with the ones  that come along with the seed that you're planting. So not so obvious takeaways. You've got to read  these books, folks. Not because I wrote them, but because this is the science behind organic  gardening. And if we've learned anything, it's that we need to be organic gardeners. We have  way too much plastic in our lives. We have way too much plastic in our soils, for example.  We don't need to add chemicals. We just have screwed things up so badly. We know it. We know  it's caused bad things. Start with teaming with microbes. Move to teaming with bacteria. Learn  how and then go to endophytic fungi and then learn how the plants use all of these things to grow.  If you do these things, you will be a much better gardener. Chemical gardeners are not good  gardeners. To learn how to use the soil food web, on the other hand, is how you become the very best\n\n\n```timestamp\n39:51\n```\n gardener you possibly can be. And I say, is this the end? Probably not. There is no question.  Some other thing is going to be discovered. Who knew in 2017 that you could get 40% of your plants  nitrogen just by simply making sure that the Rasmu-Fezzi cycle is going on? No one. And so  there's got to be more stuff out there. There are people looking for this stuff all the time.  If you're taking notes, write down the name of Dr. Elaine Ingham. She is the guru of the soil  food web. Write down the name of Dr. James White. He is the gentleman at Rutgers University who has  really refined the Rasmu-Fezzi cycle. And that's it, folks. I appreciate your attention. Be happy  to answer any questions you have. Thank you. I can't hear you, but I see you're clapping.  Oh, okay. Were there any questions I can relay?  Oh, how do you find out about Plant a Row for the Hungry? Oh, I'm glad you asked that.  Plant a Row for Hungry is sort of a self-service program that we used to be the garden writers  of America. We're now the Garden Communicators International. And if you go to Garden Communicators  International dot com, you'll find a page that talks about Plant a Row for the Hungry. All you  have to do is share food with somebody else. As a club, for example, just to encourage everybody  to plant one row in their garden, the gardener takes that food either to a neighbor that needs  it, to a church or a synagogue, to a food bank. There are places where you can take food to a\n\n\n```timestamp\n42:02\n```\n prison. The prison gathers the food. We've got hardware stores that gather food. We've got  nurseries, garden nurseries, where you can bring in excess food. They'll take it to the food bank.  There's no rules to this other than you plant the row, you distribute that row somehow,  and nothing slips between the lip and the cup. There's no money involved. There's no administrative  services involved. This is a people-to-people campaign. And it is unbelievable if you just  Google Plant a Row for the Hungry, how many different programs people have come up with.  We do it in Canada now as well. They're beginning to do it in England. 35 million people go to bed  in North America hungry every single night, or at least not knowing where their next meal is coming.  This is such an easy thing because gardeners share and because most of us tend to just sort  of leave stuff in the garden when the snow comes for the moose to eat. And that's a stupid thing.  Do you expand on the value of cover crops that are nitrogen pictures and how they actually  make the nitrogen available? Are you able to hear that, Jeff? Not really. Talk about nitrogen  fixation crops. Can you expand on cover crops and how they make them? Oh, cover crops, sure. Yeah,  well, cover crops are mostly legumes and they produce the nodules that you're familiar with.  And inside those nodules, they produce nitrogen. A little teeny bit of that nitrogen leaks out into  the soil and is used by whatever plants would grow in there. But what happens is the cover crop  dies. And when it dies, the nitrogen that's in the cover crop itself,\n\n\n```timestamp\n44:00\n```\n particularly in the nodules, goes into the soil and is then usable. That's why you can plant the  cover crop in the fall. It's producing those nodules. It's producing nitrogen for itself.  And then in the spring, you tamp it over or you just rake it over, maybe a little light tilling,  and that moves that material into the soil where the dead plant then provides that nitrogen.  Clovers are the most common one you hear of, too. Right. And by the way, I've been testing  a new clover. It's called micro clover. It's not really new. But the new trend is for people to put  in not lawns but meadows to turn their lawns into meadows. And one of the easiest ways to do that is  to add tremendous amounts of clover. This micro clover, it only blooms once a year. It's beautiful  stuff. It's worth taking a look at. But it pumps in nitrogen like crazy. And in addition to using  my lawn, I've used it on my tomato plants. And I got to tell you, it makes the most gorgeous tomato  plants I've ever seen, this mound of beautiful clover. And then after I harvest the tomatoes,  I'm going to kill it. So next year, they're going to get the benefit of this nitrogen.  And how do you get using compost for not telling just as a top dress?  Yes, the compost and you really don't need very much an eighth of an inch is enough. An inch is  wow, a tremendous amount. If you put it on top of the soil, the microbes in it, as well as the rain,  etc., work the microbes down into the soil, down into the growing zone in a couple of two or three,\n\n\n```timestamp\n46:04\n```\n four or five months. So yeah, just put it right on the surface. It has in places like Anchorage,  and you get a little bit of cold weather, it acts as a little bit of an insulation layer. We like to  put the compost down and then put leaves on top of it as mulch so that it holds the temperature  in the soil to 29 to 30 degrees in our frost zone. And it raises the frost zone so that we don't get  quite as deep frost, etc. I love compost, it's great stuff. And Tad makes some very good compost, by the way.  If I can follow up on that, I've also read studies that are showing that we're getting too much  organic material in a lot of our herb soils because of all the chemicals we have.  Yeah, I've read some of those too. It's hard for me to, let me put it this way,  most regular soils has about one to two percent organic matter. Really good organic  garden bed might have up to five percent organic matter. Can you have too much organic matter?  I suppose you could if you weren't getting soil structure, if it was replacing the individual.  But it's hard for me to see that. I can see how maybe if you use manure in your compost,  you may end up with too much phosphorus or too much potassium. That would be probably a more thing.  But yeah, I don't buy into it, frankly.  Thank you.  That doesn't mean I'm right, but I just don't buy into it. I put as much compost down as I've grown  directly in compost. I have organic matter all the time. I never rake a leaf unless it's for  putting down on the garden. I grow potatoes in just leaves, which is all organic matter. They do  just fine. So yeah, I have a hard time. But again, these are scientific papers. People,\n\n\n```timestamp\n48:15\n```\n Linda, Chalker, Scott, et cetera, they write these things. There's got to be some validity to it,  but I haven't had that problem.  I saw a picture of red worms and I've never fully used to advantage the castings that I've  generated my worm in. What's a good way to distribute that stuff?  What is the value of the worm casting as far as who's living in it?  Can you hear that?  So in other words, how do you collect the worm castings and what do you use them on?  How do I best use them? I've stuck mass on top of it.  She's got a lot, but how do you best utilize them and what's the value of them?  I use them in two different ways. We also keep worms. In fact, now that we see the snow,  I'm going to have to move it inside. You can use them by putting them in liquid  and making a worm compost extract and using that liquid on plants. I don't know really why I do  that, but sometimes I do. Otherwise, I put it right on my plants. Now, you've got to be careful  because they will contain little worm castings, little eggs. You've got to make sure you've got  the right worms. You don't want that new worm that's moving in that does the fast squiggly-wiggly.  I'm not particularly a big fan of adding night crawlers if you don't already have night crawlers  in there. The red wigglers seem to be safe, but I sometimes wonder whether we're really  doing the right thing by using them. But using the castings themselves does make a lot of sense.  They contain a concentration of the nutrients that is higher than what went into the worms.  I don't remember exactly what the numbers are. It's X amount of times more phosphorus,  X amount of times more nitrogen, X amount of... It's got higher concentrations of the nutrients\n\n\n```timestamp\n50:29\n```\n that you want for your plants, and that's why it's so good.  There is research on adding worm castings to potting soils, for example, and they found up to  I think 15% by volume. Again, this depends on the quality of castings and things like that,  but they actually got increased biomass production, growth, disease protection.  The worm castings have a lot of benefits in soils in general.  I would think because they contain so many nutrients, they raise the bricks of the plant.  And if the bricks of the plant is over 9 or 10, you don't get insects anymore. So yeah,  it's great stuff. It's every bit as good as compost. It's just...  One's thermal and one's biological, so there's a different mix of bacteria in them.  Any other questions? Okay. All right. Well, thanks, Jeff. We will let you go then.  But I really appreciate it.  Pleasure. My pleasure. Anybody has any questions, let me know. And I always tell people,  if you buy teaming with microbes, and now I'm going to add in teaming with bacteria,  and you don't like it, I'll buy it back at three times the price, because I think it's that  important that you read it. And if you want to read it in French or German or Slovakian or Turkish,  Portuguese or Spanish, we can arrange to get you that copy.  And Audible now, huh?  Oh yeah, it's on Audible, it's on discs. The same person that read John Stewart's book reads mine.  Oh cool.  All right. Thank you very much, folks. What a great audience. Thank you.", "id": "6f30cecb-bb20-4e52-a798-0b78638cb505"}

I'm your host, Tad Haseev-Kiss Organics. This is the podcast where we discuss the cutting edge of growing from a science-based perspective and drawn-top experts from around the industry to share their wisdom and knowledge. My guest this week is Bryant Mason. I've had Bryant on the podcast a few times in the past and he's one of my favorite guests. Bryant is a certified crop advisor who specializes in organic cannabis nutrition. He has spent the last five years working to combine precision laboratory techniques with data science in an effort to unravel the complexities of cannabis soil and crop nutrition. Along with his work on soilless media, he also helps outdoor cultivators around the United States with nutrient management and cover cropping. If you would like to do soil testing, help with interpreting a soil test, or are interested in an online course on these subjects, his website is www.soyldoctorconsulting.com. And if you want to save a hundred dollars on his course, you can use the discount code KISorganics, all one word. And I've taken his course and was recently going back to review some of the content. It's excellent and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to do a deep dive on cannabis fertility and reusing your soil. Now on to the show. Okay, we are jumping back in with part two of my conversation with Bryant Mason talking about soil fertility and cannabis nutrition. Why don't we talk about potassium but briefly? It's quite liquidious with the calcium so we can condense it. So potassium, I've been thinking a lot about due to the fact that for years I've recommended potassium sulfate for potassium. And that's because, well, two reasons. One is that I always suggest compost. Well, not always. I'm sorry. I also suggest compost, which is a major source of potassium. But the content of potassium varies between compost and when I look at a soil test it's often in the middle of a round and so it needs potassium immediately, sometimes going into flower. So potassium sulfate is the best organic option. Potassium silicate is not technically organic when it's soil applied. It's allowed in certain circumstances as a fungicide, foliar applied. But nutritionally it's not allowed. So potassium sulfate is kind of the product. And I've made a couple changes in the last year in my thinking around potassium sulfate. I still think it's a great product. Works very well. But I believe growers should verify their need for potassium with a\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:03:00\n```\n potassium sulfate, best practice would be to verify with a tissue test because oftentimes I'll see relatively low potassium at least below my target level. But there's sufficiency in the tissue test. And so an application of potassium sulfate is not necessary. And I haven't seen that many tissue tests that show deficient potassium. So it's possible I'm reevaluating my soil target slightly and I might lower them. So that's just one change I'm thinking about. The other thing is because of that high solubility of potassium sulfate I believe growers should increase the frequency of application. So let's say the soil doctor tool recommends a cup per cubic yard of potassium sulfate, which would be a lot. I don't recommend doing a cup all at once. The more you can break that into four to ten applications the better. Because again you're reducing the salt stress but also when you flood the soil solution with that much potassium it will completely change the cation uptake dynamics. So when it comes to epsom salt and potassium sulfate epsom salt is usually not used as I don't recommend it very often with as a soil dredge potassium sulfate I do. I think those two you increase the frequency. And then the final thing is I do think it's good to be constantly building potassium level slow releasing, more organic meaning carbon-based sources of potassium using alternatives like compost and alfalfa meal. The reason alfalfa meal is so great and I know you've always used a lot of alfalfa meal and I'm always I recommend it as kind of one of the few default nitrogen sources when I write recommendations. Historically because of this more slow releasing nature of it and the trichotinol and some of the biosimilin effects but now it's because it also brings in a lot of potassium. Because when you apply alfalfa it doesn't have a ton of nitrogen in it and so you're applying a large quantity and it also brings in a lot of potassium that's slow releasing. I would say green sand but green sand I don't think in cannabis makes sense because heavy metals. So just always be applying high potassium compost or just any moderate potassium compost and green and use alfalfa meal as one of the nitrogen sources. I would say that the second place sort of the silver and bronze metal would be insect for us which I know you love and granular poultry which I love. Those two both bring in about four percent potash K2O. So yeah I think those are the things I'd say about potassium is just trying to reduce potassium sulfate not entirely but thinking about other sources as well. Yeah I love potassium sulfate I mean it's one of my favorite amendments I think\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:06:06\n```\n In fact I want to do a talk on that here soon like the products I think every grower should have and they're not really products you know they're things like gypsum and potassium sulfate they're not expensive but you want to have them on hand for when you need them. But like you said 50 percent potassium highly soluble if you see a potassium deficiency you want to address one it is the fastest and best way to get potassium into into the plants. Okay. The what you brought up I think is really interesting in terms of splitting up your applications to lower the salt stress I want to I want to think about that a little bit and see how I can incorporate that. You mentioned compost and while I think compost is great I have moved away from recommending it quite as much for a few reasons. So one you're reintroducing fungus gnats that next cycle on a commercial scale it's just annoying and can get expensive with all the beneficials and other stuff. I mean relatively easy to deal with but still you know annoying bringing in bugs and it's a it's a vector for pathogens potentially. So I've stopped doing compost additions every cycle just for that reason and the fact that like not everyone tests their compost compost can be inconsistent so even though they have one test showing its high potassium one cycle the next cycle that that compost source could be something totally different. I still love compost I just I'm not quite as enthusiastic about it as I used to be in the past but just some just some things for people to think about as they're determining what they're going to add each cycle. I love insect frass like you mentioned it's clean it's got good microbial activity and life in it in addition to having a pretty balanced NPK value but you do have to account for the other the other nutrients in there the N and the P that you're bringing in and then alfalfa meal like you said it's such a low NPK value for the most part the N it brings in is pretty negligible and it just has a ton of different other benefits. The trichontinol is interesting because I think from what out from talking to a plant growth hormone guy I'm gonna butcher his name it was Jim Gray maybe it was Jim something or other that I interviewed on it a little while back he was a retired plant hormone guy and he said the trichontinol breaks down so quickly that unless you're putting out like actual alfalfa and just laying it on the surface that trichontinol is just not going to make it into the plant oh interesting interesting um yeah that that could be I mean I don't apply alfalfa for the trichontinol it's just more of just like a yeah and just to clarify I would only apply I would not apply alfalfa insect frass or granular poultry for potassium I would\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:09:10\n```\n knowing that it's gonna a secondary benefit is it'll build potassium but you always fulfill your nitrogen deficit first just just for listeners who that's no that's a that's a really good point I'm glad you I'm glad you brought that up and I would add further that I don't like to use potassium sulfate all that frequently when re-amending my soil and high rates I because it is so soluble I like to use it during the growth cycle kind of as that like liquid bottled nutrients yeah exactly application it's my band aid to except you don't have to use liquid bottled nutrients that's exactly well so my my liquid bottled nutrients fish I draw to say it usually that's right me too me too yeah that's not go to when I see a problem yeah yeah no I agree I that's you know there's a few things I use in bottles and they're not yeah one of them is liquid fish I love it yeah and I would mention with compost for those who have received recommendations from me you usually don't see compost because I don't recommend it if your sodium is high or your nitrogen is high or your salts are too high and I've gone back and forth about recommending it at all because if I don't know what it is I mean there's such a wild difference between a coarse manure and worm castings made in someone's basement like it's just it varies so much that unless I have a test which I rarely do I don't like recommending it so in addition to fungus snaps there's a number of other things considerations with compost for sure even the carbon-nitrogen ratio like that can really that can really screw people up quickly so I don't necessarily because I'm not able to control for all those variables as just writing a soil recommendation I too have sort of straight away from it but anyway I've just mentioned it because it is a good potassium source so if people can account for all those other factors it's something to consider absolutely and I think an interesting way to get the amendments out is to use compost to mix them in with a little bit of compost to get that biology in there when you're top dressing when you're amending mix it in with a little bit of soil or apply some of those amendments into your worm bin or into your compost piles way of raising the fertility of the pile itself but interestingly enough this is a little off topic too it's sort of a tangent but I've been having this discussion on a soil analyst form with Steve Solomon because someone posted a a soil recipe that they found online for living soil for cannabis indoors and so we got in this huge discussion about it and my my point and I think you'll agree with me on this one is all living soil recipes all soil recipes should be based around your compost because it is so variable that's where I always start absolutely so when you see a recipe online that says\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:12:18\n```\n that fraction is going to vary so much and determine what the other inputs are that I don't trust any of these recipes and I say this as someone as a manufacturer who sells a nutrient pack which is designed to be mixed with you know either something like ocean forest or pro mix or you make your own sort of living soil by taking you know our mineral nutrient pack and adding compost and peat moss and even with that my degree of confidence goes down because that compost can can like you said it can it can be imbalanced it can have way too much nitrogen ammonium you know potassium whatever totally yeah so I think that's why and that's why I don't like soil recipes and I don't people I can't tell you how many requests I've had for like do you have a soil recipe it's like no and that's why it's because the compost variability so yeah and like to kind of piggyback on that is I get requests like I want to make my own soil mix and to that I always say like that's great and then I just say but just so you understand the process for me like for me to formulate a soil is going to take let's say six months aggressively at best to probably two years realistically before it'd be something that I want to like put out with my name on it because the amount like initially you got to find your compost source you got to test that then you got to mix up a soil and see what you get and then you have to make adjustments and then once you get everything where you want on the soil test then you do plant trials and see how that goes and so right that process just takes a really long time if you want to do it right you know you can't just throw a bunch of things together throw a plant in there and if it grows well assume that you've got this amazing soil mix now if you're a home grower I think that's that's fine and I absolutely encourage experimentation but if you're on a commercial scale that's just not practical and then that's fine and I would add too that like the first thing I coach people to do is to not even worry about the chemistry well first you worry about the chemistry of the compost and you test as many composts as you have access to and you you choose the right sweet or single compost and then you go you forget the chemistry you choose those compost and then you just do like physical tests so you try to get your percentages right and you want you put it in the bed or the pot and you water it and you want and you just you feel it and you watch the infiltration rate and you have to dial in the percentages and then you go back to the chemistry and you just get the base mix right before you do the any of the amendments because to me you want to customize your amendments based on what your your base mix is and I go through all of this in my course and that like you said the process is potentially totally worthwhile but no doubt laborious and long\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:15:29\n```\n if you really want to do it right it's a process yeah and even kutz says like you don't have his mix because you don't have his vermicompost and I think that's really true um that's why I hear people that say you know kut mix works really well for me and other people that say like this this is a terrible recipe and uh you know it's not balanced at all it really depends yeah right right right well let me connect can we chat about iron real quick before we talk about oh yeah yeah carbon yeah yeah go ahead let's do it okay so it's sort of similar I've evolved my thinking on iron iron sulfate specifically but iron in general because I have observed wildly varying levels on tissue tests of iron and it's hard to know because iron contaminates both soil samples but more so tissue samples all the time it contaminates soil samples sometimes on the paste test because um little pieces of soil or clay specifically can slip through the filter paper at the lab and it will show a really high iron level in on a paste test which isn't a huge deal what's more important is if you have dust on a tissue test on any same tissue sample that dust can can go through the the tissue tests and show that you have extraordinarily high levels of iron so that could be the case it also just could be that the plant actually will sometimes accumulate huge amounts of iron at different points mostly further into flour but sometimes I'll just see really high iron levels and and sometimes I'll see really low iron levels and there are some growers that my recommendations of iron sulfate have not been able to effectively address their iron hunger I don't want to say deficiency because it's not usually not so acute that it's visual it's usually just we're seeing it in the data and I can't get that that number to move and that's almost I'm almost I'm 100% confidence because iron sulfate when you apply it um it oxidizes very quickly imagine like the chemical reaction of rusting and so once it oxidizes it goes into a an ionic state that's not available to the plant and so when you drench iron sulfate in a high oxygen soil and in a high ph soil and when I say high ph I mean anything over six it could oxidize like immediately even with a humic substance like you know when you mix iron sulfate with humic acid and you drench it into a soil ph of seven I think it oxidizes I don't see the and and the data constantly humbles me because I think I know how to do something and then I always just follow the data and sometimes it tells me I don't and so this is a big learning for me is you know in these soils that we're working in I think iron is oxidizing and very little of it is making into the plant immediately it's not to say you shouldn't apply iron sulfate because I do think there's something to say about loading your\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:18:35\n```\n or about you know in with different sort of magical rhizosphere reactions and organic acids but I think if your plant needs iron a better technique may be to core the iron sulfate 50 50 iron sulfate and elemental sulfur somewhere in your root zone in a little pocket when I say core I mean like a pocket of iron sulfate and elemental sulfur and what that does is it creates this little pocket of a low ph environment really low like in the fours maybe and at least in the fives and that keeps the iron in a reduced form and you don't what I've learned again in tree fruit production this is a technique I get from orcharding orchardists can have an iron efficiency their whole canopy is like that sort of yellow chlorotic look and they core just a little bit of iron sulfate at the base of their trees and it it works very quickly and their their trees can green up and yeah I mean you could also throw a little manganese sulfate in there actually but manganese sulfate to me is more effective with a drench so you create that pocket in the roots it doesn't need to be homogenous the roots can just tap into that little pocket and take up iron in the available form so and then the only other thing I'll mention there is again there are alternatives if you use alfalfa meal and blood meal for nitrogen again you're using those for nitrogen not for iron but in doing so you're bringing in a lot of slow releasing organically complex iron into your into your soil system which will help prevent the iron hunger in the first place I believe I see this all the time in cannabis when I I was growing commercially six years ago or something in Oregon and I would the tops of the plants would always be a little bit yellow and I just thought because a lot of plants it's just sort of normal they always green up eventually but that sort of top shoot growth that new apical growth when it's sort of light color I always attribute that to iron but again I just follow the data and I like to just look at what the tissue numbers say and address it that way that's really interesting so I haven't thought as much about iron Brandon and I Brandon Hudson who you mentioned before we've talked about this and we just look at we've just always his point was that yes the plant may need a little more iron right there but that's just because it can't keep up with the amount of growth that's getting at that point and that's just gonna green up and go away because it does so we haven't really addressed it the one thing when you said low pH and pocket my brain immediately just went heavy metals like ah are we are we putting ourselves more at risk for heavy metal uptake by having a pocket of low pH soil in the rhizosphere\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:21:45\n```\n my mental model to answer that question is that the nutrient uptake is evenly distributed across the entire bulk soil and the pocket is probably less than 1% of the bulk soil so yeah you're going to make heavy metals potentially more available in that pocket and I'm talking the size of your fist like so yeah the heavy metals will be more available in a in a pocket of soil the size of your fist but that's just such a small pocket of soil that unless you had any a large heavy metal load I don't think it should matter it's just so dilute not dilute but so small that's a really interesting experiment I would love to run it but I also don't want to then throw off all my soil tests moving forward because well okay so that's that oh that's a great point that is a great point as soon as you start coring iron sulfate you you have to ignore the iron number on the soil test so if you put your soil test through the soil doctor tool you have to disregard the iron sulfate recommendation coming out of that tool and you have to go solely off of tissue tests and visuals because the soil is non-homogeneous so you're either going to see low iron because when you're sampling your soil you don't hit that pocket and so it's going to show or you're going to hit the pocket and you're going to have really really high iron on this on the soil test both of those situations are are suboptimal and they're not accurate so you have to go off tissue have you done this with cannabis and seen that immediate greening of new growth then where you don't get that well the grow I don't see it but the growers I work with do and okay so people have tried this and seen I haven't gotten reports of the visual of the top growth yellowing I haven't asked that question what I see is the tissue test finally moves okay interesting yeah but they but they but the grower who did it did it have kind of a high well a couple have people done now but the first one he did it was did it at a rate that was maybe a little too high he said they they seemed to have a little bit more transplant shock but they grow out it grew out of it really quickly to me that means you lower the rate I don't think transplant shock is ever good um especially from a fertilizer so I told him to cut the rate in half and and do it again this guy had a really cool guy up in michigan worked with a lot tests like a bandit and so he's got this amazing body of data and we just it is like iron sulfate every round and it the numbers just wouldn't move and finally we got him to move with this this core that is really interesting I'll have to think about that and that's actually a really good segue into the next topic which is um amino acids because um well maybe not the best segue but my point is you'll see products now\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:24:50\n```\n um there there's products out there you know primarily with micronutrients that are approved for use in organic production and they're supposedly like organic forms of these minerals but when you look at the derivation statement the ingredients they're all derived from sulfates so you may have like an organic manganese product let's say but when you look at what it's derived from it's derived from manganese sulfate so are these products really any more organic or really better than just applying the manganese sulfate directly so I realize this isn't exactly what we're talking about but I want to touch start there so the amino chelated micronutrient products that I see that are certified organic are primarily for foliar is that what you're referring to so we're talking bioman albion yeah I was using this year my orchard polyamine so what those are is you're right they take these just sort of raw mineral amendments like let's say zinc sulfate and they combine them with amino acids probably the same amino acids we're using which is um ground up soybean meal it's pulverized like soluble soy based amino acids and that would be the most I don't actually know how they're made because it's proprietary but that's probably like the rudimentary way they mix them together and they chelate them so when you combine those two things it chelates them and in theory it keeps them more available so when they hit the plant leaf they're not going to oxidize as quickly and there's just better leaf penetration with amino acids better uptake efficiency and so you're getting more unit of nutrient into the plant which I believe is true now now if the increase in foliar efficiency offsets the increase in cost of the product I don't know I've always wondered that I've always wondered should I just apply iron sulfate chelated with folvic acid is that going to be way more cost effective on three acres than than applying albion metallisate iron which costs quite a bit of money um so in theory different micronutrients are chelated better with different individual amino acids so manganese for example is a little tougher to chelate so they might use uh an amino acid like pyrin glycine or something i'm making that up um but are they more organic I mean is your definition of organic like just certified organic I mean they're both both manganese sulfate and uh bottled chelated manganese is they're both certified so I don't know if they're they're more organic I mean you are applying it with carbon which is way preferable foliar but you could do that yourself you could do molasses and a little bit of\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:27:53\n```\n a touch of molasses and folvic acid would be a carbon source um my issue is there's no way to know if that if how much better they are if that if that uptake efficiency and the and the nutrient use efficiency inside the plant is that much better to justify the cost of of these branded chelated products I've always used them but this year I'm breaking my farm in half this isn't actually testing this specific hypothesis but I'm breaking my farm in half and I'm going to do every organic foliar calcium foliar specifically including the jadam stuff and and a lot of these branded amino chelated products on half of my trees and I'm not going to do a single calcium foliar on the other half and I'm just curious to see if any of them are really making that big of a difference um which let me just this is a tangent and I know I'm talking a lot but I want to just pitch to every grower listening that they should be split testing every time there's an expensive input if you can you can't do too many split tests obviously but you should break your bedroom in half or you should break your field in half or you should break your grow tent in half and do no treatment on half and do the treatment on the other half because it's amazing the level of faith that growers have in products it's amazing because in part you kind of have to because you just have to believe something and then do it but I'm here to say to argue if possible break your your room in half and you can be a little less faithful and actually put it to the test I think this is a characteristic I see in so many really good growers who I've spoken to is they're constantly testing something even if it's just one thing one thing I mean preferably one thing at a time split test whatever is your highest cost input that you're not a hundred percent confident is justifiable I couldn't agree more with you it drives me nuts the amount of products that are hyped to this to specifically to the canvas industry but it's not even unique to cannabis we see it in egg too which is crazy because I'll go to an egg conference and I'll be like talking to a guy and be like I'm pretty sure you're full of shit but like you're obviously selling a lot of your product you know like you're a business yeah it drives me nuts and well go ahead go ahead well I was just gonna say that and even I think that the the salesman too they they believe it so it's hard because when another human looks you in the eyes and they they have conviction that something works there's there's a natural tendency to to want to believe them so I don't think it's like yeah I don't think it's like a character flaw I just think it's part of human bias and I think we all just should be fighting\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:31:00\n```\n I'm testing these foliar primarily because every tree free grower in my area is is spending an enormous amount of money on amino chelated foliar sprays and no there's no nobody knows if they actually work they either think they work or they think they don't work but there's no there's no trials there's no evidence there's there's nothing and so split tests are the only way to know and they're they're not they're not scientific and that there's not replicants so you can't find statistical significance but we're not scientists we're growers so we just want enough evidence to make the right management decision so split tests are totally great and to your point realistically we just have to know what works in our grow in our environment in our garden it doesn't matter how effective it is in New Zealand you know it matters what works for me here in washington state and there's so many variables involved in that like we've talked about you know temperature moisture environment water you know sunlight all of these things are going to come into play and when i'm consulting and i walk into a facility and i say show me what you're doing for ipm show me what you're doing for fertility and that list is really long the first thing i want to do yeah you have no idea you have no idea what is doing what um i want to i want to just simplify everything and then if you want to use that you know hype product that you saw on instagram fine but let's work it back in let's come back to a baseline and then let's do some of that you know split testing a b testing and see if you're actually getting results from it because at the end of the day all we're doing is growers is trying to address what the limiting factor of growth is you know libix law of the minimum like this idea that you know if if the limiting factor is the fact that our facility has lights that are you know 400 ppfd and flower it doesn't matter what you know what enzymes yeah yeah ferment product i'm not getting enough light so um and to add to that you know i was talking to a grower the other day on scale and every time he does a foliar application um for ipm it's six thousand dollars you know that's a significant chunk of money that he has to kind of scale is cannabis yeah it's pretty they're pretty large farm you know and that i don't know if that's strictly just product or labor i'm pretty sure it was just the product and it was a more expensive ipm product a good product you know but if he's having to spray these things in in uh on his crop it's it adds up now for the home grower it may not seem like much 10 bucks 20 bucks you know whatever for a similar comparative scale but um there's no reason we can't grow healthy plants for significantly less money if we just start thinking about this idea of split testing and well yeah and i would also argue let's just put money aside which\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:34:06\n```\n the only way to become a better grower is to start to tease out what that what that low hanging fruit or what that bottleneck is in photosynthesis so um if you just want to improve your general ability as a grower you have to start to to reduce inputs that's the only way to do it um and then increase you know your flood you have to learn i guess that's what i'm trying to get at is you have to be constantly learning you know kaizen all the time otherwise you're not going to be improving yourself like you could all right so let's talk a little bit about amino acids i know it's something that you've been thinking about you know we just covered a little bit of how people are using amino acids as foliers because i suppose they have better efficacy um i don't know just give me your thoughts on that topic sure so the brief synopsis on amino acids as it relates to plant nutrition is that well there's a few things that come to mind the first is that they're definitely amino acids are definitely the best source of foliar applied nitrogen and there's quite a bit of research that shows that particularly in field crop production that the nitrogen use the nitrogen uptake from amino acid sources of nitrogen is by far better than any other nitrogen source foliar applied so big big um proponent of amino acids in foliar they are also there's a there's this idea of metabolic short cutting we've talked about this before where if a plant does uptake nitrogen in the form of amino acids or any organic form doesn't necessarily have to be amino acids plants can actually uptake larger compounds as well there's this idea that they save quite a bit of metabolic energy by not having to reduce other forms of nitrogen like nitrate or ammonium into amino acids in the plants because they uptake them they're already in amino acid form and that is definitely a well documented phenomenon but not studied very extensively so research the research generally shows I've done a deep dive on nitrogen from organic sources and it generally shows that the maximum nitrogen use efficiency results when the plant uptakes various forms of nitrogen and that's because of that metabolic short cutting idea so major props to organic production in this regard because all of our nitrogen is essentially being applied in organic form with carbon so the body of research is sadly lacking when it comes to organic nitrogen it's organic forms of nitrogen like amino acids have essentially been ignored as a third pool of plant available nitrogen but there are a few studies that show that when you incorporate\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:37:13\n```\n nitrogen use efficiency but I think what's important to point out for the cannabis community is that all organic products are either composed of amino acids or end up as amino acids for a period of time in the process of mineralization so I think what is confusing or maybe misleading is that we say oh I want to I want to use amino acid nitrogen well does that mean amino acids like a liquid water soluble liquid nitrogen from soybean or fish that's technically marketed as amino acid nitrogen because alfalfa meal blood meal feather meal all of these things are are enzymatically digested in the soil and end up in their constituent parts which are amino acids so how I think about it is when you're amending your soil with organic amendments that are nitrogen and carbon in protein form those are essentially going to create a little amino acid factory in your soil so those things as those mineralize they are going to end up as amino acids in your soil and then at that point the plant will uptake some of those amino acids it's debatable how much of those are amino acids are up taken before the amino acids are then converted into ammonium and then nitrate so all these different these three different forms all exist in your soil at the same time and all organic products are technically going to contribute amino acid so it's a little misleading to say I want amino acid nitrogen because anything organic is in a sense going to lead to that so whether I buy a soy amino product or soybean meal I'm still going to be getting amino acids in the soil because of how they're going to break down that's exactly right that's exactly right now the amino acid nitrogen from soybean meal is going to be immediate it's smaller particle size and potentially already digested into the constituent amino acids so you're going to get amino acids faster but they're both doing the same thing they're ending up at the same place and I'll add one more thing I put out a video on my instagram about amino acids a while back and my point in that video is to say that when you drench amino acids to the soil again there's not a good understanding of how much of that is directly up taken by the plant and how much of it is is eaten by the microbes or converted by microbes into ammonium and then nitrate these so these pools are constantly in flux and my argument is that again just a tiny bit of of research out there shows that the microbes feed very quickly and so the majority of the liquid soy-based amino acids that we're applying are probably consumed by the microbes not the plant and there wasn't really a major reason\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:40:19\n```\n because even if the microbes eat those amino acids they'll die and release organic forms of nitrogen back into the soil it's a cycle so it doesn't really matter but it's just interesting to think my general belief is that the microbes feed first and amino acids can turn over in soil extremely quickly so anyway that's just another small dynamic to for growers to understand and think about. So one thing that I'm a little unclear on is if the amino acids are if nitrogen is in an amino acid form is that different than nitrate and ammonium in a sense it is you talked a little bit about that what's happening inside the plant you said if it goes into the plant then it's converged ammonium and then nitrate that's part of the nitrogen cycle why would that be superior to just nitrates in your soil for example where the plant's just taking up a nitrate yeah so if a plant takes up a nitrate it has to convert it twice it essentially has to go in reverse it has to convert to ammonium and then amino acids to complex it into a leaf as a complete protein so if if the plant up takes an amino acid it doesn't have to convert it twice which takes a huge there's a huge energetic cost to the plant so if it takes it up as an amino acid it can just put it directly into a protein and complex it into the leaf so you're skipping two different steps inside the plant if the plant up takes an amino acid and by amino acid it technically any organic form of nitrogen so it could be other molecules besides amino acids so then how do we correlate this with a soil test because on a soil test we're primarily looking at nitrate levels we want to keep ammonium levels very low and that nitrogen cycling process and yeah you know that's our metric so how does that relate yeah and this is that is a million dollar question because we're not testing on a soil test we're not testing organic forms of nitrogen we're just seeing ammonium and nitrate and we're making our management decisions based on those two things and that's a limitation in soil testing there are ways that labs can test organic nitrogen but it gets complicated and confusing because there's different fractions and there's different the totally different lab technique and there's not a simple way to just test small amino acids the small fraction of organic nitrogen compounds which is amino acid so I wrote a long blog post about this called how to manage nitrogen organically it's for cannabis growers it's on my it's on my website and I break this down but to answer your question to have more specifically we are just using ammonium and nitrate we get to see two out of the three pools\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:43:26\n```\n third pool and we're just using ammonium and nitrate as a proxy to sort of understand how big those pools are because they are correlated and so my the reason I'm comfortable using ammonium and nitrate and not seeing that organic nitrogen pool on a soil test is because if the organic nitrogen pool is healthy you will end up seeing ammonium and nitrate because the microbes convert if there's excess organic nitrogen excess amino acids it ends up as nitrate so when you see that nitrate number you know between let's just say 50 and 150 you know that there was at one point there was an excess of that organic nitrogen pool and it converted in nitrate when you see the the nitrate number low usually that means there's not excess organic nitrogen in the system and so those are sort of proxies if that makes sense to to estimating how big that organic pool is a lot of growers I know intentionally keep their nitrogen they're inorganic nitrogen so nitrate and ammonium they keep those pools low so on a soil test it might be 15 parts per million or something and they feed those organic sources of nitrogen as the plant needs it and I think they do so primarily based on visual symptoms and occasional tissue tests so soil testing is flawed in that respect in my opinion for organic growers in particular you still want to know ammonium and nitrate it's good proxy for organic nitrogen but it's it's not a direct measurement and then along those lines that total nitrogen number that you can also get from on the standard test that's not really showing us that either then the reason that one's not good is because it's also like if you imagine a chunk of alfalfa meal that's not plants available that's still a protein meal so it's it's still plant material and so that nitrogen has not been enzymatically broken down biologically digested into small enough organic nitrogen pieces amino acids to be taken up by the plant so that total nitrogen number is going to give you all the nitrogen in the soil much of which is not yet plant available so amino acids they're the the building blocks blocks of proteins proteins exist in these amendments like fish meal blood meal alfalfa meal they're talking about specifically in relation to nitrogen here those get broken down biologically through nutrient cycling microbial processes in the soil in the rhizosphere and then what's released from that is potentially all three forms of nitrogen is what you're saying then we'll get some organic amino acids some nitrates some ammoniums depend some ammonium depending on uh what's going on in the soil\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:46:30\n```\n these are all tied closely to to moisture content and oxygen gas exchange in the soil as well do you want to just touch on that yes it's it's the nitrogen transformations are highly dependent on on moisture and oxygen because they're biologically driven but the third variable that i think actually matters even more is temperature so the conversion if you put in feather meal in your soil and it's cold it could take weeks or months to really become available to to be broken down biologically into those three nitrogen molecules but in a warm soil it happens very quickly so and obviously there's higher biological activity when soil moisture is optimal and when gas exchange is optimal when gas exchange is not optimal the the nitrogen can essentially that cycle will get plugged up and there'll be more ammonium usually uh but i almost never see that in a peat-based media in any kind of living soil i almost never see that just because gas exchange is pretty good that would be a mucky top soil like a really clay heavy compacted muck um what i do see is once you amend the soil or if you were to blend your soil it would there'd be so much um organic nitrogen that goes into that system that the soil would cook and ammonium levels would spike for a period of time before they get they go back down and get converted in the nitrate so if you were to test your soil right after amending you could see high ammonium if that soil is biologically active as it's converting it to nitrates absolutely have you have you seen that before i just saw that recently on a test and it kind of surprised me because i typically when my brain when i see high ammonium numbers i automatically go to unfinished compost that's just yeah where i where i head more and more i'm thinking of peat-based media living let me call them living soils because a peat-based media with a significant portion of compost i kind of think of them like compost because they're they're by they're very biologically active and they're increasing in maturity over time through through biological mineralization and and fungal decomposition and and so yeah it's unfinished compost is a great corollary and essentially when you throw a bunch of blood meal and alfalfa meal and bone meal and and fish compost into peat moss and cocoa core it essentially creates a little compost i mean it cooks and that's what that temperature when you when you when you like feel that temperature after you really mix a soil when the temperature spikes if you tested it at that moment in time i'd almost guarantee that the ammonium would be elevated yeah so what i i aim to do when i'm amending a soil is i want to get as much in there at the beginning of a run that i can\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:49:35\n```\n because i don't want to wait for the soil to you know what we call cook like a like a thermophilic compost pile so the goal and so the goal is then to amend at a rate that's high fertility but low enough that we're not causing this explosion of microbial growth that's causing this yeah temperature increase and that's that's really the trick i think um i agree that's on that i i think the same thing and i put a little note for for growers who have received soil recommendations for me there's a little note in the nitrogen i have nitrogen tips and one of them says please let me know if your soil heats up because i want to know uh so then i can adjust my rates to be what you said is right under that that um that temperature increase and some products are more susceptible i mean blood meal is way more prone to to creating temperature spikes because of the speed at which it releases um just the properties of certain nitrogen amendments will sometimes cause that and you can also smell it sometimes you can smell that ammonium um volatilizing yeah and so it's important to have your moisture content right your temperature you know in your room is if it's an indoor facility like i'm typically thinking about it the the temperature is probably going to be there already you don't have to worry about that as much but i think making sure you're not over or under watering is really important to allow that process to occur um the way you want it to and uh you can always add more you know a couple weeks later or a few weeks later to get to the get to your target so you don't have to get it all in there at once um just just some other notes on that that's right that's right uh and uh since you talked about amino acids and the fact that we don't necessarily need to buy products that are labeled amino acids to get amino acids uh you know i've recently seen some products that are you know called carbon-based fertilizers um and this idea that because they're carbon based um you know they're superior to other fertilizers uh you and i talked about this do you want to touch on that a little bit sure so i think that the in organic farming that label is kind of meaningless um because for the most part most of our or let me back up not all of our nutrients are always carbon-based so we were talking about potassium sulfate we're talking about gypsum that's not carbon-based so um in general there's a lot of benefit to to using nutrients that are carbon based and that's kind of baked into organic farming when it comes to your phosphorus products and your nitrogen products and and just you know the mineralization of\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:52:40\n```\n nitrogen product it just it doesn't it's sort of a redundant or um it doesn't mean a whole lot because all of our organic nitrogen products are already carbon-based it's gained a lot of popularity in conventional production because conventional growers are starting to realize that um there's a major metabolic and plant health advantage to incorporating carbon into their nutritional programs so i think the terminology the marketing terminology comes mostly from you know the conventional world but i don't think it has a whole lot of meaning when it comes to when when we're talking about organic uh products and i would add that when we're talking about living soils you know pee-based soilist media that's very biologically active um we we have high levels of carbon in in those mixes already um our organic matter is you know through the roof compared to anything you would see in actual soil and uh it's really important to distinguish between living soil and real soil uh i can't emphasize that enough they're very different it's like an apple and a banana or something or you know whatever two very distinctly different things yes both can grow plants but they do it in entirely different ways um and that's probably a separate podcast but i just think it's an important thing to to remind folks of yeah yeah definitely i'll also mention that um like for example when i furtigate and we talked about this earlier when i furtigate micronutrient sulfates so just going it's kind of tying this around when i need more manganese sulfate maybe i'll put in 10 pounds per acre in an application i always add a carbon some kind of carbon source whether that's molasses or kelp or usually it's humic acids that i dissolve overnight or even citric acid it's carbon based so i always am aiming to apply carbon with any application that i do and it's really easy to do that as an organic grower you just you just do the things i just said and most people are very familiar with this a compost extract or if you're top dressing you know something you can apply a little compost and then once that goes into your soil like you said in a living soil system there's so many carbon fractions in there um from there's a lot of soluble carbon a lot of active carbon a lot of longer chain the inactive carbon compounds in our compost and our peat moss so a lot of this is just happening in our living soils naturally so it's not essential to necessarily do that because as soon as it hits our soil it's a giant carbon sponge but in a top soil system i think it makes a lot of sense especially in fertilization but we don't necessarily need to buy bottled\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:55:47\n```\n vulvic acid or molasses and do it ourselves very cool so last question um i know we kind of went over some of your favorite nitrogen inputs already and how you like to have multiple sources we talked a little about your favorite calcium inputs can you just give me and i don't want to you know dive too deep into this but just some of your favorite uh phosphorus and um magnesium i mean well i already know the one for magnesium but go ahead yeah just some of your other major essential nutrient amendments like what you like to use yeah yeah sure so magnesium um really i i only think of two one is epsom salt and one is langbonite and langbonite i only use when potassium is also needed it's kind of a it's kind of a niche use case honestly um it's probably only in about 10 of my recommendations or less so when i think plants need magnesium i immediately go to epsom salt and i immediately go to epsom salt and foliar that's the first thing i think about it's complete it's totally inexpensive and it's super effective in foliar and so the first thing i do is i hit my plants with a with an epsom salt foliar and if they respond positively it usually is an indicator that indeed they're low in magnesium and then only then i would think about a soil drench um yeah that i think that covers magnesium pretty well i like to run magnesium on the low side so i do think growers i work with tend to see magnesium hunger because i like to just run it kind of on the lower end of the spectrum uh because i like to maximum maximize calcium and potassium uptake um and it's so easy to feed that i don't necessarily want to load my soil with magnesium it's better to keep it low and and apply it as needed i do i have found that different strains vary pretty widely in their magnesium requirements so some of them just just get hungry for it kind of like a tomato tomatoes like it um what were you gonna say oh i just want to add that i rarely see magnesium deficiencies on living soils where you know if you have if you're mixing a living soil you don't need to add a magnesium input you're probably getting enough magnesium from your compost and other inputs i would just i would not add magnesium unless you have a test showing you need magnesium because it has a lot of antagonisms like you kind of alluded to there um it's gonna it's gonna typically raise your pH with most of the things that you're gonna add for it and it's gonna potentially tighten soil not really the same thing in living soils but just something that i want to caution users about it's much easier to add more you can't really remove it very effectively yeah i would i would add to what you're saying this to say that i would i think i probably see excess magnesium five to ten times more frequently than i see\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:58:55\n```\n growers leech excess magnesium out of their soil and stop the use of all magnesium inputs than i am seeing a deficiency um i want to add though oh sorry with certain led lights i do sometimes seem to see uh more magnesium hunger in certain cultivars and i haven't found an exact correlation there the first time i heard that i didn't believe it but um i'm at the point now where i'm starting to see a lot more of this anecdotally and i think i think it's really a thing that's interesting yeah yeah i mean i i i see yeah i do think magnesium hunger is quite common visually um and that's why i like that foliar application i i i believe that works really really well in in addressing light magnesium hunger um but yeah the led thing's interesting i i i haven't i don't have much experience with that or i haven't noticed that at least so it's good to it's good to think about that i wonder how that would be i think it's a spectral thing or maybe it's related somehow i don't think it has related temperature but those are the only two big differences between led lights and other light sources is you get less uh leaf less rays and leaf surface temperature and potentially a slightly different spectrum interesting yeah fascinating um i'm sure i have more thoughts on magnesium but let's let's move on to phosphorus in in living soil i really like to get most or all of my phosphorus in the soil ahead of the cycle through dry amendments i think that's the best way to do it i mean everything's going to bring in some phosphorus depending on your compost source that's going to provide quite a bit again slowly mineralizing over time and then otherwise my go-tos are bone meal and soft rock phosphate i used to recommend a lot of fish bone meal but um which has a percent higher nitrogen than bone meal much better micronutrients but higher sodium so i like to and actually a little bit less phosphorus so you're getting more sodium more micronutrients and more nitrogen per unit of phosphorus so i i just go with bone meal it's a little cleaner um in that in that sense and and heavy metals is also a consideration there um i haven't seen high heavy metal levels and really any bone meal so i like to have really sort of luxury levels of of organically bound phosphorus in in my soil at the time of of transplant but there's two sources i can think about organic sources of liquid phosphorus if you want to feed additional phosphorus one is a high phosphorus fish and it is a brand name it's called seafoss\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:02:02\n```\n stabilizing the fish with sulfuric acid they stabilize it with phosphoric acid and that pushes that that phosphorus phosphate number up to a seven percent so that's a really good tool in the toolbox and the other thing i can think of which is a little bit new this is another update i've been testing tons of jadam and k and f inputs so um you know ferments and uh yeah primary i guess primarily ferments jlf but just different plant juices and the one trend across the board is that soluble phosphorus is really high in um fermented plant juices which is very interesting so i don't recommend it i don't use it but it is it is a use case for these um ferments is they're able to liberate quite a bit of phosphorus i would say the other nutrient levels are are somewhat underwhelming once you dilute them to their recommended dilution rates um but phosphorus can be you know somewhere like 60 parts per million in some of these um fermented plant juices so yeah i think that's sort of interesting to mention i've seen cannabis jlf concentrate that tests at 27 parts per million of phosphorus now all of these levels are going to depend on the nutrient status of the plant being used in the ferment um but that's significant so if you diluted that at let's say one to 20 you'd have a pretty healthy phosphorus application that's soluble but all this can be a little bit of a moot point in the sense that tady's still there sorry everyone this is when my internet cut out i was really looking forward to this discussion and i wanted to share some of my feedback on ferment tests that i've gotten back from growers uh actually showing pretty high chlorides and sodium so um maybe that's something that we can dive into together in a later conversation or possibly on instagram live or youtube live but um i'll definitely be following up with brian and i really appreciated this interview that was brian mason and you are listening to the cannabis

So there's a lot of reasons why calcium is important. It's critical in cell wall development and can result in growing tip or flower abortion under severe cases. An uptake is highly influenced by your environmental conditions meaning that even if you're supplying it your environmental conditions can lower that transpiration rate and result in a calcium deficiency which we'll kind of walk through today on some of those concerns. First we kind of need to start off with sources of calcium. There's going to be two main sources with your irrigation water and fertilizers. So just like magnesium your irrigation water can contain calcium carbonate and can prevent can be prevalent in many of the upper Midwest regions especially where you're over limestone. Us here in the southeast we have very limited alkalinity but conducting routine water testing to determine that calcium carbonate concentrations periodically throughout the year to determine that variation is going to help you understand how much calcium you need to be supplying to achieve optimal calcium fertility rates. The other source of calcium is going to be your fertilizer. So with this it would be a cow mag solution. A lot of your closer to neutral or basic fertilizers this is going to be where you see a cow mag. It's often paired with something so in this case it's often going to be calcium nitrate or calcium chloride. It can be supplied through regular fertilizer applications through irrigation or through foliar applications as needed such as on a poinsettia. So there's a lot of varieties and ways of applying this your calcium but ensuring that you're either getting it through that alkaline water or through your fertilizer is very important for your plant's growth. So calcium uptake and how is the plant incorporating it? Calcium is a non-mobile element that meaning the plant cannot take it from its reserves in the lower portions of the plant and move it to where it's needed. It has to have adequate at the point that that cell is expanding and it's moved through mass flow. So in that root zone you have your fertilizer and your calcium there and as the plant transpires you're essentially creating that draw and it's drawing these nutrients into the plant. Now the key thing is that it must be transpiring or calcium to be taken up meaning that if you get in cold conditions or cloudy days or high humidity where that plant's not going to be transpiring we're not going to see the calcium uptake and that's where a lot of your problems can occur. So calcium deficiency what does it look like? Calcium occurs on the new developing portions of the plant. So think those new leaves first expanding fruit or in that flower tip occurring. We also see this as marginal necrosis or tit burn occurring on the new growth.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:03:01\n```\n expanding it's kind of our cue but that lower foliage looks nice and healthy it's only on that new developing portion. So we see this a lot in propagation too much mist or high humidity can prevent that transpiration. So even if it's being supplied through fertilizer applications we need to be sure that our environments matching plant uptake. So propagation mind the mist and kind of dialing it back to prevent that tip abortion is critical to promoting calcium uptake and transpiration for those cells to develop. Then diagnosing calcium deficiency foliar tissue analysis is an option but it's going to be reported as a percent so looking at a concentration it's going to be very hard to diagnose since you have a smaller leaf you have a smaller volume that we're trying to see a lower decrease in even though there's a lower total amount in terms of a concentration it can be very difficult. You're going to want to sample the most recently matured leaves and you may result in seeing some sufficiency but understanding the symptoms of what's occurring kind of that you will see stunting occurring which can't throw it off is important. So calcium fertility management water quality testing is the biggest determine what calcium concentrations are not supplied through irrigation water and note that not all fertilizers supply calcium such as the 2010-20. If you're not supplying it through your irrigation water you're not supplying it through your fertilizer you're going to run into problems you need to consider a cow mag. Foliar applications of calcium chloride are an option 200 to 400 part per million on a poinsettia is recommended and you want when doing a calcium chloride foliar application we need to be using technical grade calcium chloride to avoid impurities that can harm the crop and then maintaining environmental conditions that are favorable favorable for calcium uptake so promoting plant transpiration to draw it into that new foliage is crucial. Now looking at the mimics what things can we confuse calcium deficiency for? The highest thing that we see is boron it's also in that new mature growth however the big distinction here is that that leaf is going to feel slightly thicker you'll see that leaf edge burn and kind of that stippling but feeling that foliage it's going to be thicker and brittle. Conducting tissue analysis that distinguish between the two is kind of where we utilize that foliar tissue analysis. Also phytotoxicity oftentimes we see leaf margin puckering occurring such as an ethophon application shown here on geraniums you'll see it in some very sensitive species not all and if this is the problem you know your crop is good but you just sprayed and you start to see this think phytotoxicity the plant should grow out of it in roughly two to three weeks and then that new growth is going to look good\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:06:08\n```\n problem is very important to diagnosing if it's phytotoxicity or calcium uptake problem. Also water relations plant dry down this is very common in seedlings especially in those small cell packs shown here on some zucchini where the plants dried down and we saw that leaf margin burn it can mimic that calcium deficiency in terms of water relation now once the plants are rehydrated and it's going to they will look fine you will start still see the edge burn but that new growth should look good we're looking for that uniformity across the crop if it's only a couple isolated plants in the center versus all of them so kind of what did we learn and what are our take-homes today calcium can be supplied through a variety of ways including your water water soluble fertilizers or a foliar application your environmental conditions can significantly impact your calcium uptake even if you're supplying it in one of our big problems where we see is in vegetative propagation so minding that mist create your vapor pressure deficit to get that plant to transpire a wide variety of problems can mimic calcium deficiency but time and occurrence in location can help you determine the cause that there's a lot of resources on ecro uh as well for calcium diagnostics and as well have a lot of mimics as well that i like to say thank you for your time today", "id": "10326fb7-946e-4a63-bfd6-d379eedad9ba"}

And these are showing a classic nitrogen deficiency.  They're yellowing from the bottom up.  You have pale green growth.  And at this point, I think it's probably, I don't know how these plants would match.  One, they're a little dry right now.  But my guess is when they are watered, they're probably overwatered.  And they may have bleached the nutrients out, or they just might have ran out of nutrients in the pot.  It's a pretty small pot.  So what I would want to do in a case like this is apply something like a fish hydrolisate, compost tea or compost extract,  even some leachate from your compost bin, which would all be organic options to get nutrients in there right away,  and get some available nitrogen.  I wouldn't do something like fish meal or fish bone meals.  It's just going to take too long, all those dry minutes.  And here's some larger ones.  And you can see here, these are a much darker green.  And they actually have a slow-release fertilizer.  And that's probably the difference in why these plants look good.  And these are also not organic, so they're able to do that.  If anything, I think these are maybe a little heavy in nitrogen.  But you can't really see that color coming through it.  Slightly downward-facing leaves is usually a sign that there's been too much nitrogen.  And they're a very dark green.  But that helps.", "id": "ae91132e-b166-4040-8c49-79cf02f4c64c"}

Now soil testing is very important so we know what sort of fertility exists in our bed. Sure we could go with a generalized fertilizer recommendation or guess based on what our plants look like and what sort of symptoms or deficiencies they're displaying but if we really want to dial in our fertility and know exactly what levels of nitrates, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, all of these things are in our soil then we have to do a soil test. It will also tell us pH, the EC of our soil and a bunch of really useful metrics for dialing in our soil for our next cycle of plants. Okay so the very first step would be to go onto the website at kisorganics.com. You're going to click on the amend tab and then go down there until you see the soil testing and consultations. So on that page we have a list of options of various types of tests that we offer. All of these tests are through Logan labs and the price on our website is going to be exact same price as through Logan directly so if you can order through us it does help support us. Now we offer everything from the complete soil test with an analysis all the way through to checking your irrigation water for suitability, tissue testing and then finally a standalone analysis if you have a soil test from another lab or if you have a Logan test that you got independently. We do charge a little bit more for the analysis if you don't order the soil testing through us so if you plan on doing both then the best option is this very first complete soil test. So you'll just add it to your cart go ahead and check out as you would normally and then what will happen next is you'll receive an email from us typically the same day or the next business day at the latest and it'll come from orders at kisorganics.com so be sure to check your spam folder and on that you'll see you'll get an attachment that will already be filled out. You'll just put in the sample ID in this case we use garden one and then we also have the instructions as well as how to fill out the submission worksheet and how to take the sample that you'll receive digitally as well. So let's talk about what tools you need for a soil test. Now you will need a plastic ziploc bag that you can write on and tape. You'll need gloves because the moisture from your fingers can impart sodium and other minerals that can affect the results of your soil test and you'll want either a stainless steel trowel or your hand just you can use your hand if it's potting soil like this which is my preference or a soil probe if you want to get one of those they're like $20 or you can make one out of PVC. Okay so I just switched to an empty bed because I thought would be easier for this demonstration. I've got my gloves on and I grabbed a clean bowl that I can mix the samples in so I'm just reaching down with my hand I'm pulling out a handful at about a six inch depth I'm gonna do that from multiple places in the bed so I get a more homogenous sample. Now you can sample multiple garden beds at the same time that's definitely an option you can just mix all the samples together and get a\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:03:02\n```\n in multiple samples you absolutely can too that's definitely an option but if you're trying to save money in a lot of cases you can just mix them together and the samples will be close enough or give you a pretty good idea of where your fertility is in your garden. So the next step is to mix the soil even more thoroughly together just to make sure that's fully homogenized you can do this regardless of the size of your sample or how many samples you take you just want to make sure to mix it thoroughly prior to putting it into the Ziploc bag. I'm gonna put a generous amount into the Ziploc bag the lab says they want at least two cups I always put in extra it doesn't hurt anything to include a little extra in your sample and that will guarantee they have enough especially if they have to re-run a test. Next you want to label the soil sample to make sure it matches exactly what's on the submission sheet this is especially important if you have multiple samples so that there's no issues of things getting mixed up and then the final step is just to tape up the soil sample making sure to add extra tape right along the Ziploc seal as well as taping the bag to itself just to make sure that nothing spills out during the shipping process. I found the best way to ship these soil samples if you're just shipping one sample is to use a USPS priority flat rate envelope or padded envelope and then if you have multiple samples then you could move up to like a medium flat rate box unless you're really close to their location this tends to be the most affordable way to ship these products and don't forget to include your submission sheet along with the soil sample in the envelope or in the box and you should be good to go. So after the lab receives your test they will reach out to us with the test results and the same day that we get the results we will send them on to you if you have an analysis as part of your package that you ordered through Kiss Organics we will also send you that comprehensive analysis as well. Here's a sample of an email that you would get from us they typically come from Brandon and they include some resources on our website that you can check out as well as some additional notes just the high level stuff of what we saw on the test. The test themselves this is the standard test this would be the Malik III extraction this is going to tell us everything that's in the soil from an acid extraction perspective and then in conjunction for the complete test we also have this saturated paste report. The saturated paste report tells us exactly what's available to the plant right now and so between these two metrics we're able to make really good actionable decisions about how to reamend our garden properly. And once you have your analysis you can go back to the soil report analysis page on our website where we list a bunch of helpful information like cups to pounds. Here's an example of what a analysis will look like though it'll be customized and the recommendations will be made for you either in pounds or cups as to what you need\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:06:09\n```\n freely available on our website even if you don't use us for soil testing you can still check this out as a potential resource. And then I also want to mention we have what we're calling the usual suspects and these are the things that we typically like to use in our recommendations and you can also go on our website and click on like target phosphorus target calcium whatever amendment you're looking for and find the same sort of recommendations there in terms of products that you can use in your soil. And that's really all there is to it so please reach out if you have any questions and we look forward to working with you. You can check this all out on our website at kisorganics.com or reach us through our contact page you can give us a call or shoot us an email. Thank you very much.", "id": "ba0af146-c35a-4895-82d6-42546b61a0fd"}

And yeah, yeah, okay, perfect. So let me see if I can. Let's see if I can record this. How do I do that? Record recording in progress. And that way I can send this to you later. And you can, I don't know what he was talking about, you know, and back up. So, okay. Let's see. Oh, we can tell you take good notes. Everybody knows you take the best notes. Like, it's very impressive. Let me see. Oh, wow. Okay. Where did? Okay, so that's out of the way. And I'm trying to pull your reports back up. Let's just get rid of that. Okay, here we go. Okay. Alright, so the first thing I do is I grab the Mehlic-3. So we're looking at your soil report, sample location, happy day. That's just, you know, lab number, sample depth and inches is always the same. So I skip over all of that. Total exchange capacity, I skip over that. Now, that's, you know, I think that that was one of the things that caused a lot of confusion is this is not this book that we're going through is not how I balance unless I'm doing a big field. You know, if I've got a soybean grower or something like that, then yeah, I'll jump in. But for the most part, I do 99% of my tests this way. And this is the Albrecht school. This is how Bill McKibbin does it. This is how Bryant Mason does it, Tad does it, you know, and not exactly like I do it. I'm a little bit different, you know, we're all a little bit Yeah, yeah, everybody's got their little preference, preferential way they like to approach it. And candidly, I feel like just because of the volume of soil reports that I see, and because I've been growing for so much longer than most, I mean, I've been growing as long as Tad and Bryant have been alive, you know, so I've just, I can compare a test to a result mentally pretty quickly. And so that's where I have an advantage. And so, you know, and that's why I push my targets a little bit differently. But, you know, but I wouldn't be here without those guys, you know, without those people. So so total exchange capacity, we skip over that pH of the soil at 5.5. Now the reason\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:03:05\n```\n two book clubs ago, when anytime any of your cations get displaced, hydrogen takes that place. And so your pH drops. Does that make sense? So sodium goes down, pH will go down. Right, right, right. It's like, oh my God, what's going on? And it's nothing, nothing. You did everything right. And it's calcium. It's just math. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's always something in a test. Organic matter percentage. This is one of those things that just lets me know this is not a soil. This is substrate. This is not in C2 soil because, you know, two to four percent, somebody's crushing it. I think it was you that asked about the sulfur metric. Who was that in the book club the other night? Was that you? Somebody asked about the the sulfur target on the male can. Right. That was that was a Saturated Paste report. We'll get we'll get to that. We'll get to that. Yeah. And that's and that's something that's really confusing when that's one of the reasons I beg people to do Logan because a lot of times people will do like a $20 test. And then I can't tell if I'm looking at Malik or haste or, you know, I'm like, I don't know. I don't know this report. And it's not, you know, I just love how Logan gives it gives you all the information. And it's all very easy to pull out of the report. But as far as a target metric for sulfur, I have I do not have one on the page or on the soil report on the Malik three. I do a target. And so I honestly, I skip right over that. And so Tad said that he likes to look at that and then compare that to your sulfur on the saturated paste test. I, I don't even do that because for me, it's I'm all about, you know, Tad's key phrase actionable data and my actionable data for my sulfur is on my paste report. So I just skip over it. And that was hard for me to swallow because I'm very uptight and very OCD and math is everything. I always joke that I'm athletic and I want the target. I want the number. I want to know, you know, that's what this is all about for me. And it was hard for me to just let that go. But after a while, I did and it's, it's great. So, you know, it's like, I love the\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:06:32\n```\n immediate one. And I really don't go back and look unless the grower requests it or there's a problem, you know, if you've been battling an issue, you know, for two rounds, you know, you just you're seeing a magnesium deficiency over and over again. Well, in that case, yeah, we do need to go back through the historical data. We need to talk about, you know, what your, you know, get your garden journal out and go through your inputs and that kind of stuff. And so yes and no, it just it depends. It's on a case by case basis. Most of the time, I'm just looking at the test that you've got in hand. And the reason for that is I've driven myself that shit crazy before chasing what happened nine months ago. I couldn't figure it out. I couldn't figure it out. I want to know. I've got the curious brain. I've got to figure it out. And finally, somebody grabbed me by my shoulders and it's like, look, that was nine months ago. We've got a crop right now. Pay attention to that one. And, you know, being that this is open system, there's some we're never going to know. And so for a curious brain like yourself for me, it's painful sometimes because we want to know and, you know, we're not going to be able to know everything and that we want to know here. And I would look at the Saturated Paste report and see where it was. And so I do, and you'll see here in a second when we get into some of these other metrics where I'm jumping back and forth, you know, to look at both tests just to make sure that I feel like the numbers are accurate. 90% of it is going to be interceptive root growth in a pot, you know, close to that 89, 90%. And, and right, this is, you know, the malic is your battery. It's your long term, your reserves, all that stuff. But the Saturated Paste is what your plant sees. And so that's what I, you know, that's where most of the actionable data is. The exceptions on the malic are the things that we really want to build up reserves of like phosphorus and stuff like that. But if I saw a 10,000 metric on your sulfur, I would immediately look at your Saturated Paste report and go, Oh, well, she's a 10,000, but she's low. I'm still going to add some, you know, yeah, yeah, because because what the plant sees is what's most important to me.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:09:45\n```\n you're at 1582, you're at my metric of 1500. That's my target. And so there would be no need for me to advise you to add anything at 1582. Now, what we do is we jump over and look at phosphorus at 0.77, which is below my target of two to four. And we'll get into that when we get over there. But so that's something that I would want to look at both, both of those metrics before I'm while I'm making that decision. So we'll get to that here in a second. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Well, and a lot of people are like, look how dark green and lush my plants are. And I'm like, phosphorus deficiency, like they're stunted, but you won't see it. And so that's a great conversation about the environmental responsibility, because, and I'll do this in order for you, but we'll come back to this in just a second. So when I'm going through the test, I look at your pH, you know, that's the thing that we obviously need to address. And we skip over organic matter. We skip over sulfur. We get to phosphorus. If we're at 1500, we're like, okay, we're good. We don't need to add anymore. Now, when I get down to nitrate, we're going to bring back this phosphorus conversation. So just hold on to that for a second. I do have targets. And I'm busted because I'm on, I'm recording this, but I'm not supposed to share these targets. This is, you know, these were the, these, these are monetized. And so I'm not supposed to share them. Well, but I don't, well, you're not going to share them with anybody though, are you? Well, just don't tell anybody. And, and we're fine. So I trust you. So we're good. Well, you should. Well, I mean, trust in people is why I'm in the situation.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:12:55\n```\n Yeah, promise. Promise is a comfort to a fool. That's, yeah, 100%. But I'll give you these, because they're not even there. You, you know, I can do metrics off of this, but you're, you're not going to be able to, with, with what your understanding level is right now. At this moment, I doubt you'll be able to reverse engineer a target out of these. So it's totally fine, you know. So my on, on my Malik, I'm shooting for around 4,000 calcium, 350 magnesium, and about 600 for potassium. And this is, yeah, well, I'm, I'm heavy on potassium. That's actually shorter that that's Tad's metric. That's mine's higher. And so, but those are good, loose metrics. But again, you're going to make the decision off the paste report. And that's another reason that I'm like, just take the metrics because you're not going to make your decision here, you know, you know, right, right. Where's it? Where are you seeing that number? The cash on calcium, 104.9. Oh, you're looking at the percentages. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get to, yeah. And then you'll, you'll see on, we'll, you know, sodium, but we'll jump past it just for the conversation. You know, you're at 56% on the Malik for calcium. So the Malik, you know, so what is in reserve is different from what's being made available, you know, that's why those paste report numbers are so much more valuable and important. Makes sense. And then, so sodium 47, fantastic. Anything under 200, you know, if you're at 200 and everything else looks pretty good, you know, I'll tell people to run it because I want to save you money, you know, I don't want you to flush. If you don't, you know, if you're at 200, go ahead and do the run, flush at the end and retest. But once you start getting above, you know, once you get to like 175, 180, like I'm pretty sure you're going to be at 200 at the end of the round. And so 47, fantastic. I love it. I'm super happy. Nothing I need to worry about. These base saturation percentages, I think are important. Again, the paste reports where I'm\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:16:03\n```\n 10 to 20% magnesium. I like about 12 to 15% magnesium. I'm a little on the low side, usually. One, because magnesium deficiencies are so easy. It's such a dunk. It's so easy to figure that one out visually. And it's so easy to fix just two tablespoons of Epsom salt as a drench. Boom, it's gone. And the problem's taken care of. Magnesium is the bully cation. It will outcompete calcium and potassium. And I know that, you know, yep, yep. And so yep. It in theory based on the attachments, it should be in practice, it's magnesium. And so that's where, you know, I feel like my experience, my 40 years of growing the plant come in handy because we see things all the time that work in a lab that in practice, you know, like, let's take IPM, like, you can throw a predatory insect in Petri dish with a target insect, it would never touch in the real world. But if that's the only thing you put in that Petri dish, sure, you can take a nice photo of this bug predating on this bug. Does that it's going to work in the grow room? Not necessarily. You know, and same thing with some of the chemistry, you know, in theory, calcium should dislodge everything. In practice, magnesium is the one that causes all the problems. So if so one thing you could do is you could do a, you know, so some folks flush with gypsum because it will displace magnesium and potassium and sodium, you know, so if you've got really high sodium, you might want to add a little bit of gypsum. For me, it just, it works anyway, so I don't add the gypsum, but you could do that. Yeah, and then jumping down to your trace, oh, oh, exchangeable high, let's see, sodium, so calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, other bases and exchangeable hydrogen. Your exchangeable hydrogen is just a reverse of the log that gets you to your pH. So I just tell people to ignore that one. Some people really freaked out about that one. And I'm like, it's just your pH. That's all it's just another way of another way of getting to that number.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:19:13\n```\n we have target metrics for and, you know, we know the uptakes and all that kind of stuff. So it's just easier, just a different language, you know, like I'm not going to read it to you in French because it's, we're both going to struggle. We're just going to do it in English because we're both good with that. And that's why I just take the pH. Trace elements, boron, iron, manganese and aluminum. I don't really look at too hard on here. I look at iron and aluminum. Not even looking to see really what the number is, but just to see if, if one of them is really high and one of them is not really high, then I'm going to have a concern about either iron or aluminum. Let's say your iron was, you know, 300 and your aluminum's at 30. Then that gives me confidence that your iron's way too high. And we need to address that. If I see them both high, both iron and aluminum high, most of our substrate is made up of iron and aluminum. And so if they, if, and this is something I only learned by talking to Susan at Logan, I was like, I'm seeing these weird anomalies. She was like, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. She's like, yeah, people don't know about that. And she was like, it's an iron, aluminum lattice that forms most of our substrate. And they use filter papers to when they're setting up the testing. And she's like, if a little piece of that substrate gets sucked around the filter paper, she's like, you'll see aluminum and iron both really high. She's like, if you see that, don't worry about it. And the whole reason that came up was I had a woman contact me. She had incredibly high aluminum numbers on her test. And she was, you know, I'm not immune to a conspiracy theory, but she was, she was way down the rabbit hole on the U.S. government pumping aluminum into our water and soil to kill us. And I'm like, it's, wait, I mean, they're killing us with sugar. They don't need to do this. What are you talking about? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they're killing us. It's all right. Yeah. Yeah, look. Yeah, yeah, and so so I, I really don't have one on the Malik. I see it jump around all over the place, but the takeaway is you just want to look at both of those metrics, iron and aluminum, and see if they're both, you know, if one of them is high and one's low, then we want to investigate. If they're, you know, 171 and 93, I wouldn't flinch about either. On this, on the Malik 3, the only ones that I really look at are copper and zinc. I'm looking for copper somewhere around,\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:22:25\n```\n I'm looking for zinc around 10. This is you and me. Well, if your pH is higher, you know, you could have excessive trace elements and it wouldn't be an issue. If your pH at 5.5 and you had excessive zinc or copper, you're in trouble. It's going to flood the plant. At 5.5, you're going to flood your plant with copper. So, so that's, yeah, yeah, exactly. And so I always go back to that Bruce Bugby, Utah money plant, literally, but the Bruce Bugby Utah State testing where they were doing the hydro versus the organics with the copper to see if they can get systemic benefit against fungal pathogen. They were running like 900, 9,000. I can't remember the number, but some really crazy high copper concentration. All the hydro plants were crispy, necrotic and dead. All the organic plants, the organic matter was holding on to it. And we run at a much higher pH. They didn't really talk about that. Yeah, those, once you look at the, I think 5.5 chart, 5.5 in the book, I can't remember, but just any pH, what's that? Yeah, I would say below six. I would say six. You need to start really watching. But once you get to 5.5, you can count on a problem, like you can just count on it. Yeah, yeah, but your traces aren't high. You're going to correct your pH and so it doesn't matter. Let's give you a metric for that pH anyway while we're here. 5.5, you would be adding either two cups per yard of willastinite or one cup per yard of aglom. I would go with the aglom just because you're low and you want to get this up fast. 5.5 is really low. Now, with that said, your pH is going to naturally come up with some of our amendments. So you could probably get away with the willastinite. But if it was me, I'd probably go with the one cup of aglom just to get my pH up fast. And then the last little section of the malic, the other ammonium and nitrate are your two forms of nitrogen in your soil. Some plants prefer one or the other and this does great with nitrates. And so when I'm looking at\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:25:33\n```\n it. And just experientially, we know that under one, I'm not having ammonium cycling into nitrate. So I know that my temperature is going to be stable. I'm not going to burn up my roots. And I'm not going to have a, you know, like I just saw somebody that had like all their ammonium numbers were above 11, like 11, 16. And I'm like, they're going to get a ton of nitrate from that. And so that tells me that I need to back off of my target or I'm going to fry their plants. So we see high ammonium anytime somebody adds compost, worm cast that's not finished, or somebody floods their beds. And that's just, that's just part of the chemistry of how the cycling happens. And so if you go anaerobic in a bed, you, nitrates will show up as ammonium. And that's why you get that stinky ammonia smell. It's actually your loot. That's your nitrate leaving your pocket, your dollars or your, and it's off. Yeah. So there's not a whole lot you can do about it. Once you're in a situation like that, like you've already applied hot compost to your bed, you're just going to have to let it cycle. So I would run that bed drier than I normally would. And I wouldn't add any nitrates to it just to see where I landed. But I, but I would know that that round wasn't going to be my best round. And then nitrate, you know, we want our target, you know, I'm like I said in that last discussion, and this goes back to the phosphate thing. So we're at 1582 for phosphorus, which is sufficiency right on the dot, you know, my number is 1500. Where nitrate, you have nothing, it all got washed out when you did the flush. And so it shows you how mobile, sodium and nitrates are, they both went down, you know, a lot. And so nitrate, you don't have any. If, which, which, yeah, you've got, you've got not a, yeah, you've got two, two pounds. And so so go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. So nitrate at two, the plant's just not moving. Nitrates are responsible for all your amino acids, all your proteins, everything that makes the, the makes us go around. And sulfur, too. Yeah, you have to have, yeah, other ways you're not building those aminos.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:28:42\n```\n here's a weird little conversation. Okay, so our meeting's going to end in 10 minutes. We'll do another one after it. It's just going to hang up on you. And so I'll just do another one and send it to you. I'll email it to you and we'll jump back in. Yeah. And if it, and if it does something weird, I'll call you and we'll figure it out. Yeah. But so when I see nitrate really low and I see somebody at 1582, I'm really tempted to bump that phosphorus reserve up a little bit. Now, hear me out because one, that's not environmentally responsible. The hippie and me does not like that. But the educated hippie and me is fine with it because I know that our phosphorus is not going to go anywhere. One, we don't, we don't have a runoff. Phosphorus doesn't off gas like nitrate does. Phosphorus, you know, with no runoff and organic forms that are slow to cycle, it's not going anywhere. And so we're not doing effluence. There's no environmental impact and we're going to use this eventually. And so if I gave you a full course of seven cups of fishbone meal and five cups of cow phosphorus, your phosphate is going to jump up over, you know, well over 2,300 for the next round, but then you're going to have to add any phosphate for like three rounds, maybe. And so in that way, I've got, because your nitrate's down, it's so low, I can stick all that in there, not have to worry about bumping your nitrates too high with the fishbone. And then I don't have to worry about your phosphate for a couple of rounds. And for me, that's just a great way to handle that, because let's say next round, your nitrates come back a little bit higher than we'd like to end the round above 70, you know, then, and let's say your phosphate, because you're right at the target drops, it's going to drop below the target for the next round. That by the end of the round, let's say you're at 1400. That's still really good. But we'd like to get, you know, that abundance based off of what Tad was saying, you know, the other night. So we'd like to have, you know, a surplus, a luxury amount of that phosphate in there to cycle. So in a case like this, I would say, yeah, let's go ahead and give Margaret some more phosphorus. And that was more phosphate, and we'll bump up the nitrate as well. And then that way, both of those things are covered. Thank you for the next round. Does that make sense? Why, why I look at it? Okay. If, okay, so PPMs, if I see PPMs at anything over a hundred, there's an issue because I double that. Now you're at 200. And that's my metric. That's my target metric. And my metrics higher than a lot of other folks, Bryant's 150, Tad's around 150. I think I've changed his mind to 200 now. But when I started at Kiss, he was at 150. And I'm like, we're running out\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:31:56\n```\n working. You know, everything just slows down. No matter how much exchange and phosphorus you've got without those proteins, the enzymes, the catalysts can't be made, the plant's just gonna come to a grinding halt. And so in this situation, I would give you more phosphorus, even though you're there. And then, you know, so I would do the seven cups of fishbone meal, I would do five cups of cowfoss. And that's a heavy metal dance. So we, you know, because that'd be the easiest thing, regardless of where your nitrates land, I could just bring it all in with soft rock. But then your arsenic levels are going to get high. And, you know, we've got another problem. And so there's so many factors, just a giant word problem. But there's just all these unknown factors that people don't know about. And that's what gets folks into trouble when they're doing their own balancing is just they haven't killed enough plants yet. And that's my advantage. I've just killed more plants than you have, you know. You're doing your best. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm a fan of that. Anytime Ted calls me with a plant, he's like, ah, should I just throw this out? I'm like, no, try to kill it. And I'm like, hit it with something, spray it with something, see if you can kill it, see how much it takes, you know, learn from it. But so that's, that's the nitrate phosphate, heavy metal conversation. So in a situation like this, I would give you the full compliment, seven cups, fishbone, that's going to bring in 96 pounds of nitrate. So the way I figure your nitrate is 200 is my total, I'm going to subtract the 96, I'm going to subtract the little two pounds that you've got. And so our gap is 102. Yeah. So 200s are charging. 200 pounds. Yep. 200 pounds per acre of nitrate is the target. And so we are. So we have to, so I don't even have to do that. So this is already in nitrate for us and PPMs. So all we have to do is multiply that number. The, you know, the metric you have is one, all we have to do is multiply that by two. And so now we know that our pounds of nitrate per acre is two. So unlike spherus, because we have to convert that from phosphorus PPM to phosphorus pounds per acre, and then we have to convert it to phosphate, they've already got it as nitrate for us. So we're done there. So that's where I get the number two. So I'm subtracting from 200 my target. I subtract the 96 pounds I gave you from the fishbone meal, the seven cups of fishbone meal. I subtract the two pounds that you've got on hand. And so I've subtracted\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:35:02\n```\n of different nitrate inputs. I use the cleanest ones I possibly can. So in, and I have, I have three that I've kind of narrowed it down there, my favorite. And so typically I'm going to give you alfalfa, soybean and feather. And so if I know your gap is 102, let's see here, put this down. So if I do, so this is where I do a little bit of math. So like alfalfa and soybean, that's 31.7 pounds per cup. So then you don't need to pay attention to this. I'm just throwing numbers out. So let's just say, I know just from repetition that one cup of alfalfa and one cup of soybean is going to give me a certain known metric to fill your deficit with. And so if your deficit is 102, I could divide that by the 31.7 that I know is going to come from the soybean and mean, or the alfalfa, I'm sorry, and in 3.2. So you could just do 3.2 cups of alfalfa and soybean, but we want to use as many, you know, minimum of three is my rule for nitrates because it gives you better release rates. Any input that you get is going to have its fines. So there's a fast little flush of nitrate from Feather Meal because of the fines, but then it slowly breaks down and trickles out through the rest of the round. And so something like blood meal, it's going to be super fast, very available. You're going to burn through all of it in the first month. It's all going to be used up. And so I like to do multiple inputs for different release rates with a gap of 102. Let's see, minus 31.7. And then I would divide that by Feather Meal. And so you could do one cup of alfalfa meal, one cup of soybean, and 2.6 cups of Feather Meal. I like to keep the numbers a little more close together. So what I would probably do would be 31.7 times 1.5 is 47.55. So I would take my gap or your gap 102 minus the 47.55. And I know that came from a cup and a half of the alfalfa and soybean. And that gives me a deficit of 54.45. I divide that by 26.4. And that's 2 cups of Feather. So for your recommendations, I would say 1.5 cups of alfalfa, 1.5 cups of soybean, and 2 cups of Feather Meal. And that will fill your entire gap. And part of that is already being filled by the fishbone. Does that make sense? And the media density, the grams per centimeter,\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:38:21\n```\n it does, I'll just call you right back. Yeah, less than a minute. How about this? So the takeaway on that is that it's a cost trade-off. We don't want to spend the extra $100 to have them do our density and base things off of that. Oh, we're back. Okay. So let me get this on. Recording in progress. And we'll go back to your reports here. Okay. So we are leaving off with media density and moving over to our Saturated Paste report. And so this is where most of the action happens. Ph, we've already dealt with. Soluble salts. This is the number that Tad looks at probably first. He makes a lot of quick sound assumptions based off of this number. My target for soluble salts is around 1,000 to 1,200. Something that I have noticed just again from looking at thousands of reports is that this number really is just reflective of your calcium magnesium and potassium. It should be more, it should give us a better picture of nitrate as well. But it really, oh, why did that happen? Okay. Sorry, my computer's doing weird things. But that number really seems to just reflect calcium magnesium and potassium and sodium. So if you've got anchlorides, but nitrates, I used to think nitrates were reflected in that and it doesn't really seem to be because I'll get really low numbers with really high nitrates. And so anemonium. And so when I'm looking at that number, I use it mainly as a guesstimate as to how I'm going to balance my cat ions. There's not a lot, you know, there's not really actionable data for this number. It just lets us know if we're close to our targets or not. 425 tells me without even looking at your calcium magnesium potassium that they're going to be low and sure enough they are. Yeah, so 4... Yeah, 1,400. Once you get over 1,200, you could grow well, but we're going from sufficiency to past, you know, you could keep it in balance, but once\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:41:27\n```\n talked more yesterday as chatty as I am. I talked more yesterday and I have it a long time and I had the yellow overpump. I'm a little scratchy this morning. But yeah, so that just tells me that your cat ions are going to be low. And sodium and chlorides can be reflected in that. So sometimes when I see a number at like 1,200 and the cat ions are really low, I'm like, uh-oh, let's check that sodium in that chloride number and then they're high. And so some bad actors can be reflected in that target. And again, there's not anything you're going to do about that target. You're going to do your actionable data off the rest of these metrics. You'll see the same thing with sulfur. So chlorides at 52, hooray. I love it. Fantastic. Nothing to worry about. You should be able to... With your sodium and your chloride metrics where they are, you should be able to get several, four or five rounds and without even having to think about flush. If you don't get that far, then we really need to look at your water. But based on how great your numbers came down in the flush, I have to assume your water's great. Yeah, I think everything looked really good on that. Yeah. Once you get to 200, let me see here. Sorry, it's trying to get me to save our last conversation. Where do I want to do that? I don't want to do that on the desktop. What's it doing there? Okay. Sorry, I'll do that later. My housekeeping later. Yeah. So 200. 200 for chlorides. Between you and me, you can probably go to 300 on chlorides. Most everybody's trace elements are low. Everybody's are. I don't worry about it because if the chlorides aren't high, it doesn't block and you don't have issues. As long as you're not overwalking or having chlorides, trace elements are rarely going to be the limiting factor. That's why, and they're so easy. I know I say it all the time and it terrifies me to give out recommendations. For the most aggressive people, I give them a half rate because I know they're going to go higher than that and it really scares me because it's the heavy metals and traces are the only reasons I would ever throw out soil. If I got hoplaten, if I got root aphids, I might throw out soil. But aside from an IPM disaster, heavy metals and yeah, that would be the only trace elements too high. Bicarbonate, it's 34. That's fantastic. I won't say never. Maybe one in a thousand tests. I'll see a bicarbonate issue and it's\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:44:37\n```\n reflecting all over. Your pH is going to be, everything's going to be weird because you've got hard water if you've got bicarbonates that high. You're great at that. Sulphur 37.82. Your sulfur is quite low. I think Bryant targets 63. I target 68. You can add elemental sulfur, but you look at that pH at 5.5. Don't you dare add elemental sulfur because you're peaking trash. When I see soluble salts at 425, I know the cations are low. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, they're all going to bring in a bunch of sulfur. They're all sulfate additives. They're going to bring in a bunch of sulfur and bring that up. It's something I mentally know. I'm not going to do any direct action. I know that my sufficiency will come in when I add calcium, magnesium, potassium. Here's a fun one. Phosphorus at 0.77. So you're below the target. You are better than most. Most folks, I think Justin's usually down around 0.3. I think Ted was picking on his numbers the other night. That's the only reason I'm missing that. That tells me that at the minimum sufficiency of 1,500, you're getting 0.77 available. So there's two things we could do. We can bump up your reserve, which we're going to do, and or we could add microbial mass, mammoth pee weekly just once a week. If you're doing more than that, and this just comes down to a cost consideration because mammoth pee, microbial mass, those are all expensive products. I don't like to run them more than once a week. That's where I would go, okay, I'm definitely going to tell Margaret to bump up her reserve because it's a combination of the two things. You've got to have a high reserve, the higher reserve. I've got some people that have phosphorus reserves above 3,000. They're running microbial mass or something like that once a month, and they've got six PPMs because their reserve is so high. It's double what it needs to be. We don't get the fish hydrolysis with phosphoric acid stabilizes it. Otherwise, when you open that jug, it would explode in our faces. It would be horrible, and it would smell worse than it already does. Because that is a liquid. First and foremost, it's a liquid.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:47:49\n```\n at the house. I don't want to buy liquid products, and I don't want to use liquid products just because of a cost thing. Why buy water? Yeah, but you can't get mammoth pee. They're concentrating the numbers, and to do that properly, it has to be delivered in a liquid. Where the science is now, I'm sure they'll have a granulated 10 years from now, but right now it's in liquid. I've got lots of dry amendments for nitrates. I've got dry amendments for phosphorus, and so I want to recommend everything I can as a one-time pre-plant amendment for several reasons. Cost, and a big part of that cost is touches, labor dollars. If you've got to mix and pH and apply fish hydrolysis, that's going to be really expensive by the end of a round. If all I've got to do is throw in a little soft rock and some nitrate, it's going to be much more manageable financially, fiscally responsible to do it that way. I love fish hydrolysate. I'm a big fan of it. When I do my transplant, I'm getting off topic here, but when I do my transplant, I'll take a 45 gallons of water and a 50-gallon drum. I will brew my tea. I will start my tea at 6 o'clock in the morning at tomorrow. I've got my water. There's no chloramine in it, so I don't have to chemically treat it. It's just going to sit out and bubble overnight. I've got good clean water. I dump my specific grow fish hydrolysate one cup for every 10 gallons. It's on the jug, but I only do it once around. I put the full spring fish hydrolysate into that 45 gallons. I pH it so that it's back into a safe range and won't kill all my microbes, and then I dump my finished tea the next morning into that bucket. I don't add the fish hydrolysate until that morning either, because you'd have a real stinky mess waiting on you if you did. You want to use that stuff pretty quickly. I make up this super potent fish hydrolysate inorganic, aerated, active compost tea, and the plants just explode. I'll use it in certain applications, but then mostly I've got fish hydrolysate sitting around\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:51:01\n```\n it's starting early, I've got a heavy fade in week five, I'll go ahead and hit it with fish hydrolysate. As far as it is a good way to get available phosphorus, it's a good way to get available nitrogen, I only use it in emergency situations. I would much rather try to, like I had a really less than intelligent person say something really smart to me one time, and he was trying to, he said he'd rather be a sniper in any position, and what he was trying to explain was that he would rather take on any professional situation with the answers in hand. He wants to be sitting on the mountain looking down as a sniper. He doesn't want to be caught off guard, and so that's my approach to doing these soil reports. I want to try to give you everything you need to get to a round. There was a guy I talked to earlier in the week, and he's like, man, I'm not getting to the round, and he's like, and I don't want to say it publicly because I love KISS, and he's like, but I'm running out of gas. I was like, bro, say whatever publicly. We want to support growers and we're not hiding anything and we're very transparent. And I was like, what's going on? So he's getting to day 30, and he's starting to run out of gas, and he's still got another 30 days. I said, okay, well, what's your planning density? He's doing about eight plants per four by four. And I was like, okay, well, that's not too much. You're not, you know, overdoing. I think four to eight, anywhere in there, we've been able to demonstrate. Yeah, I did 20 in my last round just because I had to. Yeah, yeah, I just I didn't have any place to put my genetics. And so I just ran them, you know, and now I've got a place to put them and I'll I'll probably only have four to six plants in this next round. But so his planning density checked off, checked his par, I checked his his environmentals, VPD CO2, da, da, da, da. Everything sounds good. How long are you vegging, man? I'm vegging for three and a half weeks. And I was like, oh, okay, well, there's part of the answer. And so what he's told me, you know, think about it, veg, think about how, you know, we're driving the plant 18 to 24 light, you know, a day, hours a day, as opposed to 12, we are thrown on biomass like crazy post stretch. There's no biomass. It's all the plants doing everything just for reproductive potential. And so three weeks of veg, you know, two and a half weeks of veg that he's doing, one, his plants are going to be 12 feet tall. But he's, he's burning up, you know, if you one week of veg is like a week and a half, two weeks of flower. And so because you're just doing much\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:54:13\n```\n three weeks of a veg, I was like, Oh, okay, well, I guarantee you, I was like, dude, I'll bet you money I don't have, you drop that down to a five, six day veg, I bet you make it to finish, you know, and so I'm always happy to go through people's targets, adjust them, you know, and like there's folks that, you know, might have a really heavy feeder, I might have to change that. They might, you know, they might need to get their metric bumped up a little bit, but I'd rather bump it up as a one time pre plant amendment, potassium being my only exception. And then run the round out, and then work with the grower for a couple of rounds, you know, somebody like yourself who takes notes and is, you know, knows what they're putting into their beds and that kind of stuff. It's pretty easy to dial that in and we'll get you to where you're not having to do the fish hydraulic state, like I used some fish hydraulic state on my seed run this year, but that was because I had, you know, 40 gallon pots. I had four plants per pot because I was just, it was a seed run, I'm just hunting, you know, I'm doing female hunting seeds. And so I kind of crowded the room, I got more, way more females than I thought normally it's 50 50, I probably had like 75 80 percent females. And so I didn't thin the room down that greenhouse at all. I was blown away by how fast things grow, you know, summertime in Washington States, just amazing, you know, finish is a whole other disaster story, but daily lighting or gold, the light just drops off in September, October, so much that finishing outdoors is just, I wouldn't try, I wouldn't advise it, you know, I'm against it. But I feel like, you know, in that situation, because I vaged starting those plants all went outside at the very beginning of March. So March, April, May, June, July, like, I've been in this, I've been in those pots for five months, growing. And I mean, I'm doing a haircut, I'm chopping them off waste high every week. So they're putting on biomass. So there's no way for me to keep up with that as a one-time pre-plant. And so I had to go to fish hydrolysis. I don't feel bad about it at all. But that's a perfect situation where the tool matches the problem. I think it's just better money spent if we can put it all in as a pre-plant dry amendment. So that's why I shy away from phosphoric acid as, or fish hydrolysis, as part of a recommendation. And then the other thing, like, if I get, if you feed it one time, okay,\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:57:22\n```\n I'm really scared to give people fish hydrolysis, because they're going to do it every week, you know? That's one of the biggest hurdles for me as an agronomist for KISS is I'll give people keys to the castle, but they'll go sit in the moat all day. And I'm like, no, what are you doing, you know? Oh, bro, I know you told me to do this, but so in the forum said that this was the bomb and I'll plant it. And I'm like, call that guy. Call that guy. Don't call me. Oh, geez. I stay off of forums completely. I will touch them. You couldn't pay me. You couldn't give me a thousand dollars to even look at a forum. It gives me a headache. There's so much bro science and so much bad information. And it's canonical. People will fight to the death over it, you know? And I'm just like, I'm not, I'm not good with that. I'm a dog that's been bit too many times. I don't turn the other cheek well. I know I'm just going to get slapped on that side too. So it's like, I feel like it's pearls before swine. You know, you're in there as a professional agronomist trying to help people and they're just cussing you out and telling you how stupid you are and, you know, old man. And I'm like, well, if you want to get slapped by an old man, call him the old man. Like, don't, I don't need, I don't, you know, and so like, I'm in there trying to help people and they're just yelling at me. And so I'm like, I'm, I'm taking my ball and going home. And so I just, you'll never, yeah. Oh, well. Okay, so let's, let's do calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. So here's that actionable data. So, so just to wrap up your phosphorus, the two ways to do it productively and responsibly are to bump up your reserve and bump up your applications. Because the applications are expensive, I prefer to bump up the reserve. That's the process that we're in and your nitrates will allow for it this round. So perfect. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, we're looking at the percentages below the pink box 78%. It's just too high calcium, magnesium is fine. Potassium is really low. Sodium is fine. So when I look at those, I go back up to the Oh, and I skipped over something. So on the Malik, let's go back to the Malik for two seconds and look at your magnesium percentage on the Malik. It's a little tip, little trick for you. So anytime, so you're at 5.06. If anytime your magnesium is above 10% on your Malik test, ignore it on your paste report. It doesn't matter if it's low or high or whatever, ignore it. It's going to be low,\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:00:32\n```\n cations are just invisible. And that goes back to magnesium in practice and actual field practice. It does run the cations. It will out-compete potassium. It will really prevent your potassium from getting into the plant. So my targets, and again, this is just between you and me, calcium 200, magnesium 138, and potassium 125. So 238 and 125. Everybody is everybody. And that's why I ask people to do that second application of potassium sulfate. That's the only one that I ask for a second application of it. It's because I look at all these reports and you could have been 125 on your last test and you'll come in canonically at 10 every round. And it's just everybody's low. And from our discussions, we know that potassium and calcium, that's what puts on weight. That's what puts on yield. So if you're Steve and you want to grow the most vegetables or the most nutrient dense vegetables with the highest mineral vitamin and enzyme levels as opposed to carbohydrates, I'd say let's let that potassium drop. But for cannabis, we're not going to eat it. We want to smoke it. We want yield of that potassium. And that's another reason why forums suck. Because those are two completely different paths. They're both correct, but without that background information, you don't know to do that. And people will fight to the death about it. And I'm like, oh, well, if you had read the other part of the story, like Rostas are always talking about the half that's never been told. And I think that that's what I think of when I see forums. The half that they don't know is what the problem is. Yep, my targets are all in PPMs. I ignore the 5.25, the 105 and the 2, the 0.22. I don't even look at that. I'm just looking for action because my targets are in PPM. So 238 and 125. And so the first number I look at is magnesium. I skip over calcium and I look at magnesium and I see that it's low. Because what I'm going to do if it's high, you know, let's say my target's 38, let's say your magnesium comes in at 52. Okay, so rut row, we've got high magnesium. So if it's real high, you know, if it's above like 70, we might want to flush. You know, once you've got double your magnesium, we might want to flush. But the normal way to correct that, let's say your magnesium is 52 and your calcium is 104, you simply divide 52 by the target 38. And that gives me a factor of\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:03:41\n```\n target is 273. So it went up from 273 to an account for that magnesium excess. Does that make sense? And so I'll add extra calcium and extra potassium beyond what it would take to hit sufficiency to balance the magnesium. Yep, yep. And so in this situation, I look at magnesium, it's 12.63, so it's low. And you're below 10% on the malic. So I'm like, okay, cool. So I jump back up. So I know that magnesium is not an issue here, it's not a problem for us. So I jump back up to calcium 200 minus 104.9. We have a deficit of 95. And so you would add three cups of gypsum, calcium sulfate, which brings in that sulfur wormison. So that would handle that. Yep, every per yard. Yep. And then so then we go down to magnesium targets 38 minus 12.63. So the gap is 25. So there's two ways you could approach this. You could add 1.1 cups of magnesium sulfate or you could do nothing and wait and see if you get a magnesium deficiency. At 12.63, you probably will. But then sulfates are so soluble. It's not like if we're, if we notice a nitrate deficiency and we're going into that's why we want to do the fish hydrolysate because it's immediately available. If I add organic phosphorus and nitrate, it's going to be two weeks before the plant can get to it. That's what's so great about all these sulfates. They're going to respond in 24 to 48 hours. So because you're low at 12.63, your gap is 25. Normally you'd add like 1.1 cups. A lot of times what I'll do is I'll just lie to people and I'll bump them down and say like add 0.74 cups of magnesium sulfate. One, I know that most growers go in with a heavy hand. Two, even if they fall short, it's so easy to fix that with the magnesium drench. The plants will respond in 24 to 48 hours since a lot of times, Tad, when he's doing recommendations, he'll skip over magnesium as long as it's in deficit and just tell him not to do anything unless they see a problem. And that's, that's a safe way to handle it. A lot of times I want to make sure that you've got enough to get going. You know, magnesium is, it's the central element in the chlorophyll\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:06:54\n```\n I'll lie to the grower and tell him a slightly lower number than they should do because when I sleep better, I know they're not going to, even if they go in heavy, they're not going to ruin their soil. And if it's short, it's so easy to fix. It's not going to hurt them. You know, you're not going to lose weeks of flour waiting for your magnesium to catch up. So, and so in this case, we're doing the three cups of gypsum, you could easily safely do 0.74 cups, 0.8 cups of magnesium sulfate. When it comes to magnesium sulfate and potassium sulfate, epsom and potassium sulfate, I think it's a weird calcium and magnesium both got a name, gypsum and epsom, but potassium, they just left it alone. But with potassium and magnesium, it's usually very, very small amounts under a cup usually, you know, 1.3 max. And in situations like that, I like to mix that up in solution, spray it out evenly over the bed, and then add my amendments on top of that. And then work the amendments in because getting one cup of magnesium sulfate spread out evenly over a four by four, or sorry, over a four by eight, it's going to be really hard, you know, you're going to have dead spots and hot spots. And so a lot of times with epsom and potassium, if it's a cup or less, I'll make it up in solution. Does that make sense? Okay. And so then potassium sulfate at 8.65. So I know that the maximum I'm going to add a potassium sulfate just from doing it over repetition, it's going to be 1.3. Like gypsum, I'm never going to add more than six cups at a time, potassium sulfate never more than 1.3 cups at a time. And so I know that if my, you know, my metrics 125, anytime I'm 100 or under, I'm going straight to that max level. So I see that you're under 25. So I know your gaps at least 100 or more, 1.3 cups, and then a half cup after stretch. Again, because just looking at thousands of reports, everybody ends up low, no matter what, you know. And so that's how I do a soil report. Like that. Oh yeah. So, okay. So trace elements. So percentages, not a big deal. Trace elements. And again, this is just between you and me. But here's my little cheat sheet. So for boron,\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:10:00\n```\n to see that 0.75. Manganese, you're low below 0.2. I like to be at 0.2 to 0.4. Copper, and zinc, I look at those numbers on the malic, but 0.02, 0.02 is fine. And then aluminum, I would like, as long as it's under 1, I'm not too worried about it. Aluminum is 1 that I'm just looking out for toxicity, as it's not, the plant doesn't need it. But yeah, so that's all, and that's all something that, if somebody, like yourself, we could get this bed dialed in really easily. A little bit of phosphorus, a little bit of nitrate, a couple of sulfates for cations, and boom, you're done. And so at that point, I would be thrilled to go through your trace elements and be like, okay, let's bump that boron up, I'm gonna give you a little bit of this, a little bit of this, and we'll get everything bumped up a little bit. For folks that don't really care, usually big facilities, hybrid facilities where they're doing salts and veg and organics for flour. A lot of those folks will just put most mix of soluble traces, MOST, it's a jack's product, they'll put that into their soil. And that will cover it. And salts are damaging to our microbes and our biology, and we know that and that's great, but it's not nearly as bad as the food web folks would make you think it is. It's just not that deleterious to, your biology will come raging back. And so I don't really worry about that so much. Yeah. And it, yeah, we did it. And it keeps us out of heavy metal issues. That's why I like the jacks because back in, you know, a couple years ago, even three years ago, I was just, man, throw some glacial rock dust on there and all of your traces are accounted for, it's not gonna be a problem. But now I'm real concerned about that, you know, because, you know, if you're in Massachusetts or Maine, you're gonna fail, like guaranteed, you're gonna fail. Yeah, anytime. I hope I answered your questions. And Merry Christmas. Yeah, I always look forward to talking to you. I always enjoy our conversations. And I really appreciate all of your, Ted and I always laugh about it. Like he actually said something about it. Finally, he's like, man, Margaret scares me, man. She has hard questions.\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:13:14\n```\n Thank you. Thank you. Well, I hope, yeah, you too. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas. And yeah, I'll talk to you very soon. If you got any follow-ups, just let me know. Take care.", "id": "d3076fc0-b14f-46b9-a67e-1cc70cfe527b"}

Got to get in the right mindset here. Totally. We're obviously having a live right now, guys. What is happening? We're just jumping into it today. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. It's another Organics Q&A with Tad Hussie from KISS Organics and myself, Chad Westport. We always like to turn it over to you guys in chat, try to answer the questions as best as we can and elaborate on those. And actually, Tad, last episode, we were talking about foliers and burning plants. And I clipped some of that and put that in an upcoming video. So that'll help out, too. We are clippable. People can clip this into smaller pieces and get cool little stories. Nice. Everybody in chat, what's going on? JMJ, let me start this one real quick. And yeah, go ahead and toss them in chat, guys. If you do put a question in front of it, sometimes that catches my eye a little bit faster. I know Tad and myself are looking for these. But we did have one from the other week. We always said if you miss us in the chat, if you're watching us on replay, leave a question in comments. And this one came up. Let me go and change the top thing. I always like it better when it's the bubble. I find it easier to read. But it says question. And this was from Dadgroves. So shout out to Dadgroves. It says, hey, guys, I am going to reuse my soil to put it into a bed. Should I remove the root balls? Or should I leave them and just put it in the bed? And to clarify this person, which helps because traditionally when I have seen leaving root balls, it's already been in a big bed. You don't have to plant that same spot. You can just go right next to it. But to clarify in this situation, Dadgroves was going from seven gallon pots into a three by three bed. So therefore, I imagine you're just dumping your pots, mixing the soil, probably amending. What do you think about root balls though? Advantages, disadvantages to leaving a root ball in? Yeah, are we talking about composting to reuse it or are we talking about composting to get rid of it? Do you want me to just answer the question here in terms of transplanting it into a bed? So for example, in my four by four bed, I have some of my house, I finished the cycle out. I had six plants in that bed. And what I did was I removed the root balls, whatever soil comes off. With that, I would just shake gently and then I took the root ball out. And I did that for a couple of reasons. One is because of viral and viruses. So hop latent viroid, if for some reason it got into my bed, we know that the greatest concentration of viroid\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:03:00\n```\n So by removing that, I'm lowering my viral load. And that's a good thing. So I don't think I have hop latent virus I'm doing everything I can to avoid it, but this is one way to lower viral load just in case. The other reason that I removed my root ball is for heavy metals because any heavy metals that are accumulated in the plants typically are going to go into the root ball as well as the fan leaves and all of those things, more so than the actual flower bud. So by removing it out of the system, if you think of this all as a system, by me removing that, I'm lowering that heavy metal load as well. So those are the two biggest reasons for removing them. Now, the argument for leaving them would be that I'm not disturbing the soil as much. So potentially that soil structure, soil ecology, and again, this is soilist media, so it's not quite the same thing, but essentially that sort of no-till mentality is that I would leave all that there and plant around it, let it compost and break down naturally in the bed, and that this disturbance is bad. Now, I don't believe that disturbance is necessarily a bad thing indoors. Again, we have to just look at the context that we're talking about, strictly indoor beds. I'm not talking about outside in a field or a garden. I would handle that very differently. We can talk about why, but in this context, I don't have a problem disturbing that bed or moving the root balls, sort of getting everything reset, putting my nutrients right back into the rhizosphere, area around the roots where the plants need them, and then starting over. Sorry, I got distracted by the question here about hop latent virus, but we can talk about that too. So, anyway. Yeah, GLVD is a direction to go, but please, if you wanted to finish that thought there. Those are the main reasons. So the two main reasons for removing it, just to reiterate was heavy metals and pathogen pressure, viroid pressure, that things that might have built up in the plant tissue itself that we want to move out of the bed. The reason for leaving it is this sort of no-till approach of not disturbing the soil at all, because some people really do believe in that, and I kind of touched on why I don't necessarily subscribe to that, but I teach their own, it works really well for some people, and I'm not here to say that it's right or wrong. Yep, and that is commercially we did, we left, well, sometimes we took the root balls out, but a lot of times we left it in there, but now knowing a lot more about the HLVD in particular, I think that's probably a practice that has been changed there. I think it would be wise, again, commercial settings, as you said it, but there is, you did also touch the no-till mentality, and that's typically what I have, I hear from people it's like, well, you know, it's like my mycorrhizal, my fungal strands, little of the community,\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:06:02\n```\n but when we talk about no-till out in like traditional farming, it's not necessarily literal no-till, it's just basically to a certain depth, is that correct? Or is there literal no-till? Outdoor, there's different methodologies in agriculture that are like low-till or less soil disturbance that are definitely better than purely-tilling. There are rare circumstances where we might till soil outdoors as organic farmers now. Indoors, what we're doing is not truly-tilling, and I have a blog post on this on our website, people want to read a little bit more about sort of our philosophy on it. We're definitely disturbing the soil and changing the soil structure slightly by digging in there, but the microbes are very resilient, the microbes reproduce quite rapidly, and I'm of the belief, and maybe this will change down the road as we learn more, but I'm of the belief that if we can mix the nutrients down into the rhizosphere faster rather than just strictly top dressing and waiting for things to move through the soil profile, because certain nutrients like phosphorus just don't move very far or very well, so by getting them into the rhizosphere faster, I see typically a better plant response based on what we've done with a lot of different grows and facilities over the years. So again, that's not to say it's better or it's right, that's just where my experiential data has led us to sort of believe and follow through on. And when you look under the microscope for two soils, one that's been quote unquote disturbed and one that's no-till, I don't see a lot of big differences in terms of overall microbial biomass or morphology or diversity or anything like that. And just touch here, potent product Steve touching on the HLVD. This is only detectable in flour. If you're using veg tests to determine infection, you're not actually ensuring they are clean unless it's a flour test and he points to Kevin McKernan in a recent paper. And that just kind of goes to the reason why I bring that up too is this is something that is constantly emerging. I know the roots really is something in the last couple of years, I heard personally being the center of focus because concentrations in the roots are typically higher. In the plant tissue itself above the soil, it's latent for a reason. It doesn't always test or it doesn't always show up but I would do wondering if flowering is some sort of trigger pathway to it. So I'm gonna have to look that one up. Yeah, I can't say I've heard that. That doesn't mean it's not true. I will have to look up that paper. I do know that it is a load. So we're talking about the amount of viroid that's building up in these plants over time. So I would expect it to be higher in a plant that's had a longer life cycle. But we're still learning more about that.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:09:07\n```\n we are talking about testing roots now. We've learned that that's the most effective way of testing these plants for hop latent virus And then just to touch going, since we are talking about hop latent virus now, I know that there's a person out here. I can't remember the name. Oh, Immortal Dreads that has a real issue with the fact that I put up a post awhile back showing larger node size associated with as a potential symptom of HLVD. I just wanna clarify, there's a lot of different symptoms for HLVD, whether or not you wanna argue with me about this particular one being a symptom. I got this information directly from Dr. Jack Munn over at Three Rivers Biotech. And basically there's a variety of symptoms and we cannot know definitively. There's some more classic symptoms like sort of that lateral branch, horizontal branching where, yes. So it looks like a, I think of like a candelabra sort of thing versus more traditional branching where you'll have a more vertical angle to the branch as well as very brittle branches. But there is no visual symptom that is definitive without an actual pathogen test from everything I've learned about this. Yeah. And some of it is genetics, to be clear, you could potentially see some of these things from genetics as well. So while things aren't definitive, we do need to be aware that there are symptoms. So if you're running the same genetics and all of a sudden something new appears in terms of display appearance, a big drop in yield, then I think it's worth doing pathogen testing if it's something that you suspect. I'm not here to fear monger about it though. Again, it's all about viral load. And we do have a lot of growers, like we have worked with growers that have had it in their soils and are still able to get consistently good yields by just keeping the plant really happy, reducing the amount of stressors in the environment, in their watering cycle, and just making it through flower without really triggering that virus. But the minute they have like a flood or they miss a water or something gets really off, then they usually see a greater collapse than they would if they didn't have HLVD. And that's something that we have worked with growers on that we have testing to support. Thank you for wrapping that one up. I had a thought there, then I just saw another question come in and it left my head very quickly. Okay. I know. I'm sorry guys. We're getting some good questions in here. And I think we touched the HLVD enough and it just came back to me. So that was one of my concerns. Usually takes about 20 seconds. And then we'll wrap it up with this one. It was just more of just kind of a point of thought for some people. But I use an aero cloner for taking my clones and roots as we kind of know have been shown HLVD carrying the highest virus load.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:12:13\n```\n if you had one in there and it's hitting the water and it's splashing them. Well, it's gonna splash all of them as well. So that's something to think about for people who use aero cloners myself included still use them HLVD tests are actually if you're that concerned they're relatively cheap these days they're cheap enough to make it possible if you really care. So that's a good thing. Yeah. I think it's around $15 a test with the company that we're working with we're sorting out the pricing on it right now actually but yeah, that's absolutely affordable if it's something that you're really concerned about with particular genetics or if you have a lot of soil that you're worried is contaminated because it will end up in the soil. But what you mentioned is actually some research from doctors in Mirapunja that shows that two plants that were sharing a water source I believe in this case he had them in the same tray that was able to transmit across just by the water that was coming out of one plant and coming in contact with the roots of the other. So yeah, it keeps getting funner which is a favorite word of mine but yeah, the more we know man every day goes by but let's get to something that we might know and I know Brandon is probably his fingers are already working in chat right now. Yeah, we were gonna get him in here. Okay, the next one can be Brandon he can take my place in the next one how's that sound? Or we can all do this but yeah. Yeah, we do need to get Brandon in here because he's on awesome resource but it's all funny and good to see in here question for Chad or Ted what do you recommend that's organic for powdery mildew outdoor a few weeks into flower. So a few weeks into flower I'm picturing a bud or a plant that isn't quite yet budding it may still have some stigmas popping out maybe a little puff ball but nothing that's heavy bud set yet so I could still spray something at this time I would think so. Yeah, there are people that there are ways to do it with oils will effectively work as a suffocan but you don't really want to use them in flower and they're not the most effective they're not your really your go-to for PM even in veg which was something I wasn't as I wasn't up to speed on up until recently so some of your best options I think are microbials like mill stop is a great option I believe that's from BioWorks and then the one that everyone goes to that is effective it's just not much fun to use is sulfur and you have to be very careful with it those would probably be the two I would look into first but yeah I mean it's really tough like I think a better thing to do is to try and focus\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:15:18\n```\n we have identified genes that show PM resistance in cannabis and so finding plants that contain that would be probably your best option and then know your environment so like here in Washington state it's where I live on the West Coast where you live to it's nearly impossible to grow without getting PM outdoors I just it's kind of a exercise in futility so I would avoid I would make sure I have an environment that's not conducive to PM and where I can have a fighting chance and then choose genetics that are gonna show resistance and then beyond that you could look into these things like mill stop and sulfur but you really have to stay up on it because the spore pressure like today right now I'm looking outside it's oh it's probably like 50, this 55 to 60 degrees it's misting it was sunny yesterday you know we're getting massive swings in humidity like the VPD outside right now is garbage for cannabis plants I would expect like I already know I have PM all over my squash I know I have some PM on the couple outdoor plants that I have out there and it's just really hard so yeah I feel for you whoever's dealing with it right now and my computer my internet kind of cut out there for a second so I don't quite know if you did touch this one but bacillus subtilis yeah there's stuff around raw milk too lactobacillus yeah there's various microbials that you can definitely turn to yeah now if we were in this situation though if we were in this situation what would we do I would probably start with some defoliation if I can again you do have to look at the environment too this is why I don't grow outside where I live because I know every September just when you think you're gonna be like this is gonna be great you wind up crying like it's just Pacific Northwest so yeah I would probably start something like that here's Brandon chiming in with the bacillus subtilis it works way better as preventative hitting the plants with the drench and foliar earlier in the season so kind of preemptive again if I were here I would be doing that but if it were you and it was outside right now and again we could still probably spray something would oils be your answer or what would it be at this point I try to avoid oils I probably start with something like a mill stop I mean whatever it is you're probably gonna have to keep spraying it because even if you use an oil you're potentially I mean it kind of depends how far you are in the flour\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:18:22\n```\n you know week or two in the flour yeah yeah it's kind of you're kind of in a tough spot so I would try and focus on some microbial see if you can knock it back with that and kind of go from there yeah it's a little bit more situational I don't know I could give you a generalized answer because it is it is a tough one one thing I do want to mention though is that in a recent interview with Dr. nothing can't forget her I'm forgetting oh Nicole Goche she I think she's with the University of Kentucky she mentioned she's a plant pathologist and she mentions that there's two species of powder powder mill that infect cannabis one of which is really a generalist and that it is it is it is the same thing that you'll see on like cucurbits squashes be aware that you can have so if you see it in your garden there is a chance it could spread on your canvas plants that's not to say that it is that species or the same species but the only way to know that is by working with a pathologist to have it identified so best practice if you're not going to spend the money on testing would be to just keep your squash or any visible PM that you do see show up in your garden away from your cannabis plants and that's you know again hard to give specific answers outdoors because there are so many variables I mean again inside we would say okay change the environment control that make sure you have airflow all of these things you can't really control rainstorms outside so there's so many variables but indoors we do have a little bit more control we are getting towards winter and really if you live anywhere where we live you're not going to be grown outdoors so is there anything that you're going to be doing to your garden indoor to get it ready for winter some people I know will change back over to like a HPS or their old HID systems if they live in a cold area because it's not as efficient as far as the electricity bill but when you combine the use of a heater which the winter I switched over to LED I was like man I need to buy a heater now so that's usually the one consideration I have is there anything that you're doing indoors or is there anything like cold that's going to affect nutrients moving around or something that may catch people off guard for winter growing indoors I think you have less pest pressure so you have an advantage there that's one reason to run your garden in the winter versus in the summer or spring no not really I mean there's a difference there between LED and HPS in terms of efficiency electrical efficiency and you will see more a need to heat your room potentially or have a long room where you can bring in warmer air\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:21:27\n```\n with a colder environment but that's about it so like for me I'm running LED's I will have to use a heater and run a more sealed room and supplement with CO2 or draw air from my insulated garage but because the garage is separate from my house I can't bring my conditioned indoor let's say 70 degree air into my room I'm talking about an unheated garage that's insulated that when temperatures do drop down below freezing that air is probably too cold so at that point I'd want to probably seal up things up and run CO2 and not do quite as much air exchange I would potentially still have to do air exchanges especially at night to make sure I'm not getting too high in CO2 but not a continual air exchange and you have you know people if you're watching on the Chad Westport YouTube channel go to the KISS Organics YouTube channel as well you can see some of Chad's grows and the nice beds that he uses and they're elevated they're off the ground that's one thing having grown in a good point uninsulated garage before keeping the pots off the ground whether it is a raised bed or something as simple as a pallet that's an important part of winter growing if it is uninsulated garages which a lot of people are doing yeah that's a really good point I'm glad you brought that up because I didn't think of it but yes just getting your pots off the ground whether that's a pallet or some form of insulation it makes a huge difference and then making sure your water too you're controlling the temperature of your water so it's not freezing I've been running my blue mat system from an outside hose back into the garage and I'm going to have to change that for the winter that's another thing I'm probably going to shut that down and hand water because I can't use that outdoor faucet when it gets really really cold and I don't want to be bringing in super freezing water so I'll bring the water in in a reservoir in the room condition that water to a better temperature and then water with that and aerate the water to increase my DO slightly right now one thing that kind of you know as I was realizing you do need to move them to the uninsulated floor because cold, cold soil temperatures will affect the movement of nutrients it always seemed to be like magnesium or phosphorus that I was seeing does cold specifically bind certain nutrients or prevent the uptake of certain nutrients that's I can only speculate on yeah I mean it does reduce nutrient uptake overall it reduces if we're talking about soil temperatures\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:24:29\n```\n soil microbiology so it affects nutrient cycling nitrogen is primarily oh there goes Brandon nitrogen is primarily cycled by temperature it's controlled by temperature so that's a big one in terms of nitrogen cycling to nitrates which is what your plant wants and then phosphorus like you said you typically see like if you allow your planting things get really really cold in there you'll start to see purpleing of stems and leaves and that's typically associated with cold temperatures related to phosphorus uptake yeah and that you know because everybody loves a good conspiracy theory when they don't know the real truth was the myth, the bro science of well if you want to get purple in your plant then you just make it cold and I always like to kind of think like a step behind that it's like oh anecdotally we do kind of see it it is true but why and it's not necessarily just the cold makes it purple but the cold is affecting the uptake of a particular nutrient that is actually a catalyst for that type of expression so yeah I always thought that was kind of interesting yeah Friday Piper just mentioned rubber stall mats I use those in my gym for like on the ground for working out those will work really well though we're not for insulting insulating cold concrete that's a great suggestion yeah like how thick though an inch at least an inch oh I don't know I mean anything's going to help I would think I don't know how thick those are I'm guessing mine are like three quarter off the top of my head but I mean the thicker the better but that's also a cost consideration too I would think even half inch on up would make a significant difference in warming your plants and you could always use that as a base layer and then put a pallet or something on top of that too many ways to get the plants elevated but do get them elevated if you're in a cold floor concrete floor whether yeah basement garage any of that let me go back we have a ton of questions today this is awesome I can't I can't keep up with like the comments and then the conversation it's a lot I really love all the engagement I appreciate it guys it's fun oh here's a selfishly blatant one I just wanted to put up real quick I'm going through the questions I'm going through the questions guys I'm looking for the next one but Brandon Outdoors is growing some testers here growing in a pumpkin patch full of PM 0 PM on the plants at the moment so everybody knock on wood for us but that's awesome to hear because yeah Pacific Northwest growing is real I've not seen it myself so alright fingers crossed yeah that's great it may not be the same species of PM but it's always a good idea to\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:27:31\n```\n he's not counting on these plants for his personal stash which is kind of convenient but yeah it's good testing good testing I appreciate it just one more maybe to kind of stay on the powdery mildew the PM tip here it's a CW garage thanks for joining us it says hey Chad and Tad how do you go about identifying and mitigating powdery mildew on an outdoor organic grow hard to tell the difference between moth dust and PM for me typically PM is going to smear off so the rub test doesn't necessarily pass I wouldn't think moth dust again I'm not really sure I've come across moth dust I don't know if it sticks to the leaf surface if you blow on it like powdery mildew would maybe stick on it I do know powdery mildew though again being an indoor guy with my little black light my UV it glows in the dark I don't know if moth dust does but Tad is there have you come across moth dust before or is there an easy answer here I have no idea honestly what moth dust is I assume like I've touched moths before and a little residue comes off on my fingers I can't imagine seeing that on my leaves if I saw it just on a random a little bit on a random leaf towards the edges of the leaf I probably wouldn't get too concerned I just take the leaf off and forget about it but if I came back the next day and there was more I think okay maybe I do have PM you can look at it with a jeweler's loop and see microscope and actually see the webby I don't have a great eye for it I'll be honest and I have been fooled so like I had I had some plants out here that had this it looked like it looked like bird poop almost like a seagull it just was just like pooping on it was scattered it it was kind of all over and it wasn't consistent and it didn't look like it was spreading necessarily and I had taken some pictures and I showed them to this pathologist Dr. Goche who I had the interview with and she looked at him she goes I don't know what that is send it to me and I sent it to her and the moment she got it in the mail she goes oh you have PM it's PM and she didn't know that I didn't identify the species that was going to get back to me about it but interesting enough one of the guys I work with Andrew he's down in Shehalis which is like an hour and a half south of me he was seeing something similar on his plants and so and we thought maybe it was something like leaf hoppers because we both had leaf hoppers we thought maybe it was related to leaf hoppers like maybe it was their poop that was feeding a fungus or something it didn't look like traditional I didn't know that\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:30:33\n```\n to me I guess is my point and even when I took images with my dino light and sent those to Dr. Goche she she was not able to identify it but visually until she actually saw it in person so it's not the easiest thing to identify always I guess is my point so and I wouldn't confidently say yes or no without sending it to a pathologist but there are there is some telltale that it's covered at PM it's very obvious or by any of my squash right now all my pumpkins at PM I like the solution and that's just getting a closer look that's kind of where my brain went and I was sitting here on the on google I'm like moth dust what does moth dust look like it's basically the scales that come off and that's kind of why they look dusty which if you do look at it close enough you may be able to tell the difference between the shapes that you're seeing so mold PM kind of specific easy to pick out compared to something like that so all right that's a that's a good way to do is try to identify it if you can't get the pathology testing done yeah I see another comment from Brandon that was a good reminder that we should have we should have brought up to I didn't think of is silicon I did a great interview with Dr. Wendy Zellner talking about SI she is the silicon expert and one of the things that you can do as again as a preventive is to run higher levels of silicon it will help with your PM resistance overall and that can be done using AXEL 16 which is a potassium silicate or diatomaceous earth or willlastinite any of these things that contain SI will help and there's research behind those three in particular that I've seen in relationship to cannabis and there was a question that kind of tails off of that from Troy Bailey he says can you please expound on willlastinite in soilless grows potentially the benefit or why do we see it in some and maybe not in others yeah yeah so willlastinite is also known as calcium silicate I've seen a few other names for it make sure that the best ways to go back to calcium silicate that's probably the best name in terms of referencing it online and it's very similar to agricultural lime which is calcium carbonate in the sense that it will raise your pH but instead of getting carbonates you're getting silicate so you're getting potentially some SI like we talked about it will raise pH as quickly as agricultural lime it is more expensive and it can contain low levels of heavy metals so be aware of that too but that that goes for all of these soil amendments it just if you are\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:33:35\n```\n to make sure you test before you add into your grow regimen but I love willlastinite I think it's a great option for all growers I absolutely sweet and here's here's kind of another question going back to the winterization basically of the garden chunky nugs thanks again for joining dude this is a question he says I'm nervous about leaving my 20 gallon living soil pots outdoors in Vermont that just makes me go burr he says should I push the pots together and cover with a tarp and or straw so the tarp is going to be beneficial from probably getting waterlogged I imagine if they are on the ground you can maybe try to elevate them too so they don't just wick up moisture that way if there's anything in them straw straw tad straw is going to help keep that soil temperature a little bit warmer but it doesn't sound like it's going to be used so aside from like flooding from rains which would be bad because that's going to ruin the soil structure that's going to change the quality inside are there other things that people should consider as far as over winter storage of their soil yeah so if we're talking about soil that is outdoors and like let's say you just did an outdoor grow and that soil is going to stay outdoors for your next grow if you were to cover it you would potentially be keeping more of the fertility in the pots that could be leached out because of the soil structure of soilless media which I assume we're talking about here I don't worry too much about the waterlogged issue because these pots usually drain so well and the microbes are so resilient they can handle the cold they can handle the weather that to me is less of a concern okay if you are taking that soil and storing it outside though and then planning to bring it back indoors now you're potentially bringing it's just another vector for pests and pathogens I would probably want to treat that soil with something like a trichoderma or botanical things like that is a way of or combo the two is a way of just ensuring that I'm not bringing something back indoors with me when I bring it back in all that being said when I started this grow I had some soil my indoor grow I had sold it outside for 18 months under a tarp in a giant tote and that's what I used to kick off my grow and I ended up being fine it just depends really the one thing I will say is that soil was definitely lower in fertility because it had been outside and water had gone through it it was sealed in one of those big yard totes\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:36:37\n```\n fertility more than I actually realized once the grow was up and running so yeah I mean ideally if you're concerned and you're taking indoor soil you try to keep it indoors and outdoor soil you want to keep outdoors but if it's just the reality of your life and situation just be aware of the that is a potential vector and then you can treat it accordingly based on sort of your risk profile around it like I'm okay with the fact like if I bring in a pathogen I just know I'll have to deal with it because it's just a home grow it's not it's not my livelihood if I was consulting like commercial grow in this case I'd say there's no way we could do this it's not worth risking crop loss or the thousands of dollars we would have to spend to remediate the amount of like soil or things to get you through a cycle if you did have a problem so it's different advice for different situation soil stains outside yeah you could cover it you could throw straw on it both those things that I guess the point of doing those things would be to maybe reduce some of the I would just plan on re-amending that's a little higher in next the next year before you use it again yeah Good Brandon is throwing me off here Brandon was just down in Portland you know we should talk when he comes on talk about that and the workshops coming up in the future from Kiss Organics or from Brandon himself as well I know you're going to be back on the road doing some more facility tours is that right Yeah I don't know that I'm going to do a full facility tour I'm going back to collective elevation so I've already kind of posted a tour of their facility I'm going to try and maybe do a little video there but it's going to be more of just like a community hangout in Bozeman Montana with like a barbecue and people can get a free tour of the facility as well which is kind of cool if you're in the area and we're going to do like a Q&A and hang out sort of a thing with Adam and myself and I think maybe David Perone will be there too possibly mentioned so Yeah that's Is he related to Dennis Perone by chance No he is not David's an old friend of mine he used to be the head cultivator at T-God which is the Green Organic Dutchman I think is the full name up in Canada it was one of the largest organic grows in the world at the time when he was upsetting that up so Yeah that's the plan it is I will look it up while we're chatting and find the link for you for anyone that might be in the Bozeman area Yeah So I get some barbecue and a tour of a facility that sounds like actually kind of a rad day I would do it and I did want to bring that up too because you made the excellent point of and this is something I talk about all the time because\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:39:39\n```\n people who I talk to and engage with we are doing this on a small non-commercial level and there's definitely different advice for different environments different scales regardless of ability sometimes I don't know too many brand new people with a facility but a lot of new people with tents and stuff so yeah the advice may be a little bit different the methods may be a little bit different so I appreciate you again pointing that out and putting that out there I was going to say we can get away with a lot more at home but it's not get away with anything we can do as much if we're on top of our game so let me well you get to spend more time with your plants at home you get to spend more money per plant than you would you get to do more labor so yeah that's one of the advantages of home growing and you can care for your plants a lot more than they can on a commercial scale oh there you go I sent you the link because I posted in the comments I was posting to your comment page so that was all people can check it out if you are in the Boseman area it'd be great to see it it's a really fun event yeah you're just going to come hang out with other like growers and cannabis enthusiasts it's free and you're just going to see an awesome tour of probably one of the nicest facilities I've ever seen these guys are just phenomenal growers yeah their bedroom was the coolest thing I've ever been and I was shocked or their mother room sorry and I think I showed photos last time on here of it you can go check it out on our YouTube page if you want to see that tour good I was going to say yeah that's up on your screen hey guys girls watchin I did just kind of try to post that under Chad Westport in the chat just let me know if that showed up for you guys if not if you guys find a way to do it sometimes YouTube stream yard they're not so handshady with links let's see here there's a few questions in here I don't know if there's one that you wanted to jump to I could start with JMJ on the top of the list here yeah we can just go top to bottom I suppose yeah yeah definitely let's do that and let me here blow it up again I love this okay always in the house always with good questions it says question what do you consider best dry worm castings or fresh straight from the bin to worm teas or pure worm leachate so okay let's question worm teas I think that's like second question worm teas or pure worm leachate like make a worm compost tea or extract\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:42:41\n```\n that's exactly and that's kind of where my mind was going I'm like let's settle that one first so worm tea and pure worm leachate the difference between the two worm tea is correct me if I'm wrong here it's kind of brood or steeped whereas the pure leachate would be as you just said the run out directly from like the bottom of your bin or however you're collecting it kind of the difference between the two and is there a large like nutrient just gap between the two I would imagine the pure stuff is stronger yeah I would I would say what we're calling a worm tea here just to clarify I'm gonna say that's like a worm compost extract or worm worm compost aerated compost tea where we put it in a bucket we either stir it or aerate it for a period of time maybe we add a food source to that to feed those microbes the purpose of those teas is for microbiology we're trying to increase nutrient cycling from the parent material which is that earthworm castings and the worm leachate will contain some of those microbes but it's going to be primarily primarily a nutrient solution so there's going to be a lot less microbes by volume than what you would get from the first method so it really depends on what you're looking for the worm tea I think you could burn plants potentially with based on the level of nitrates that could be coming out the bottom which will vary depending on the amount of food sources and other things in terms of how that earthworm castings were made because all earthworm castings are not created equal same with compost there could be a big difference but yes the leachate would be considered a nutrient solution if we want to classify things and the worm tea we would call a biological solution or product and that kind of brings us back to his first question and maybe it was kind of answered there but when I think of like he's asking what do you consider best castings or fresh straight from the bin and this goes back to Eurea or chicken manure as a popular source it's too hot when it comes out fresh it always has to cool off for a while and so I'm wondering if that relates to dry worm castings whereas that may be less hot and safer versus the fresh straight from the bin which I'm picturing does that analogy carry over from like chicken to worm not quite because the level of nitrogen that we're talking about is significantly lower so I think\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:45:43\n```\n fresh or fresh or worm castings or just worm castings where we've maintained the moisture content at a decent level so treating it like it has a plant and it's sort of a moisture level just to give a rough visual for people is a good idea because this will keep the microbiology alive and happy if it does dry out that just means a lot of these microbes are either going to die or go dormant it can still have the same level of nutrients in there and it can those microbes are not necessarily gone you could probably reinvigorate them by adding water to it getting it back up to the right moisture content by adding a light food source like unsulfurated molasses or organic alfalfa meal as a way of feeding those microbes and reinvigorating it but in general I think using fresh or fresher castings is probably the better of the two options but don't take the dry castings and just assume that they're garbage and again this all depends on how much of them are actual castings based on how much the worms have actually worked through that material how how long they've worked through the material what that material was in terms of their bedding and the food sources that you've had of all those things are going to affect the quality of the the worm castings and the nutrient content of the worm castings and in my head and why I went there is because I'm thinking and just again tell me if the frame of reference is wrong in my head thinking of the worm castings as like a manure and then that kind of where I was going with that was like cold manure versus you know hot alpaca poop cold manure take it straight from the field put it on your plants not a worry whereas like the chicken manure you would definitely not take it straight from the field put it on the plants because you probably would have a problem so in the sense of manure so do we think of worm castings like manure or is it just like you said that the nutrient load is so low it's pretty darn safe regardless of how you treat it it's pretty safe I mean it's the same with insect frass both of those things don't really need to be composted like you would with a larger animal you just don't see the same levels of nutrients in those products and yeah going through an insect or a worm is seems to produce something that's a little bit safer for plants in terms of nutrient levels yeah I guess it wraps back to the point I was just making a while ago on a different topic scale matters so alright scale matters with the poop oh jeez let's go to another question here genetic memory farms says\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:48:45\n```\n looking for customers for the next decade that's a magic ball question right there stressing me out man he goes on to say we seem to be losing grow shops fast and it's not just ordering Amazon product sponsors how do we stop losing growers and get new ones which is a multiple questions in there and a good one I personally have experienced loss of a grow shop it would take me over half an hour 45 minutes to get there that one closed my next option is a little bit over an hour away when it comes to like soil those things are expensive great argument for learning living soil using larger beds amending it treating it right reusing it a good argument for that but man as you know kiss it looks into the crystal ball you know how do we stop losing growers and get new ones hopefully we're not losing too many growers but well we had I had a grow shop so I know how hard that is when people can go on Amazon and find things cheaper or practically just as fast what we try to do to differentiate ourselves is education and customer service and we hope that that will bring people back to us because there are other companies even in the living soil space that are obviously way larger than us way more popular in us and selling millions and millions of dollars of product more than us and so what we try to do is just really focus on the customers that we do have we have gotten by I think because we've I think that draws in a lot of commercial growers that are looking for science-based information so that's been really helpful and then focusing on helping people with soil testing expanding into things like now we offer beneficial insects and HLVD testing and blue mats and I work with people on lighting and things like that so we've kind of had to wear more hats and diversify from just soil but this idea of selling soil that you only buy once is not the most commercially viable business model and I really don't want to be a company that's just pushing products or saying hey you know you can buy my living soil but then you should buy these enzymes and this ferment and this biological product we really want to think about it as like how do we simplify this process from you know start to finish with a good yield as affordably as possible and we're just hoping I'm really banking on the fact that people are going to be attracted to this concept and realize that we can take a science-based approach to organics we can do it for less money\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:51:47\n```\n I think that's the biggest thing for me because right now there are other companies out there that are crushing it in the space and I'm just hoping to stay relevant by focusing on customer service and education so we're here to help people and we do it all the time and you would not believe the variety of questions and diversity of knowledge of the people that we work with I get to be on the phone with a large scale grower that's tens of thousands of plants sometimes and then my next call will be with a guy with four plants and a tent that wants to decide if he should use beneficial insects and I'll probably talk him out of it because it's just not cost effective on a scale so it's kind of fun to have that range of conversations and to really just help people grow better plants success I mean we all know everybody knows since the Donna time word of mouth is the best form of advertising and that starts from happy people with good products treated well educated and that have success success is number one and hopefully it is going to be scalable because you mentioned the science backed approach and that's something that we've kind of been working on here for a while just together is finding something that's good for specific cannabis varieties good for all cannabis varieties but specific custom tailored like soil blends to specific genetics why going back to that whole success thing man if you show people and you can lead people towards success they're going to be successful on their own they're going to be happy and that hopefully it creates more people and that's a model that will infinitely grow but if we have a couple other things so one we're working on a botany course an online botany course so people that like myself for example that are passionate about plants but didn't grow up necessarily I didn't get my degree in horticulture I was fortunate to go back to school and take botany from this particular professor Don Marshall who's been on the podcast but I wanted to make it accessible for other people like we get a lot of guys who are growers that are growing commercially that never got to go to school for this but want to learn the basics so they can understand the mechanisms why things are happening not necessarily just how to treat it but like if you understand the mechanisms then you can really expand your knowledge so we've been working on that course that will be for gardeners and for cannabis growers and then also on a more involved cannabis course they're working on too and then also partnering with people like yourself to come up with specific formulations for genetics so that like if someone's running Chad Westboard seeds they can get the exact same results\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:54:49\n```\n you know the exact same program so that's just another sort of thing where we can say hey you know seven gallons of soil Chad Westboard genetics just water it and you're going to add a half cup of like maybe a boom booster week four and then you're done for the cycle on the fertility side that's another goal of ours with expanding things but yeah it's a challenge and I'm working in the background right now to doing those tedious documentation of every little thing I've got some new tools to use that so again set people up for success you know document everything take off my hat scratch my head look at the plants standing on my left foot it'll all be in the notes so people can have success and that is kind of a joke TP says that's no joke well Chad we got we got what we got like five more minutes here five more minutes I know we both have to sign off today I got to go pick up my daughter from preschool pretty soon get the dog to the vet so yeah we both have to jam guys again questions if you have them we'll try to sneak them in here at the last minute if not or if you're watching on the replay just put them in the comments either on the kiss organics YouTube channel or on the Chad Westport YouTube channel we will see them we will get to them we won't be back in October we will be coming back in November so get your questions in we're going to have a rapid fire fun fest when we come back but yeah tad about a couple minutes left anything you wanted to add or get in here before we go I think we can do your last two starred questions if I don't talk too long all right cool let's do it mr. just cool and as flowers about to start and I have auto flowers normally they last in fox farm ocean forest do I need to use liquid formula or use dry amendments depends on how much time you have left to go in the current condition of the plant one being faster acting than the other tad what would you say here quick answer is it depends so size of the plant genetics are going to play a huge role in terms of how many days of flower the plant needs to last I wouldn't lead to dry amendments in this case just because it's the liquid formulations are going to be faster acting so they're just probably a little bit easier for you it sounds like if you're just starting out growing for the period plants something like fish hydrolysate or the seafoss is a good option for you is sort of like a cheap bloom fertilizer Pacific grow makes both of those those are good options otherwise you could just have some sort of organic bloom formulation on hand is a way to get through flower this first cycle and the next cycle we could talk about soil testing or we could talk about\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:57:51\n```\n for ways to manage your soil or get dry amendments in there for the next cycle cool all right I'll cut you off for there that was a good answer so we could get the last one in here and I actually added one but it dovetails onto this one so real quick daint Gardner hey chat and Ted I have a question about compost tea it says can I just stir it every 10 minutes for an hour so six times over the course of an hour don't have an air pump or air lifter so stirring it serve the same purpose as a consistent bubble you're not going to get the same quality of tea if you were to make an area compost tea versus just the stir method the stir method to me is more it's less about the length of time I would just do it I would just stir it for 10 minutes and then call it good and call it a compost extract what you want to avoid if you do the stir method is adding a food source or a lot of food source because you could cause the tea to go anaerobic by dropping the dissolved oxygen in the water because you're not adding enough oxygen to the water because you're not using an air pump so in cases like that it's just a matter of agitating the water to try and extract the microbes off of the soil or compost particulate out into the water that you can have water into your soil so yeah if you stir it every 10 minutes for an hour and then applied it you're going to get some of the benefits from the microbes that were in the tea but you're not going to get the reproductive benefits of multiple cycles in the line to really like reproduce and concentrate so you're applying orange juice instead of concentrated orange juice I guess is a simple way to say it that works and to dovetail on that Mick Groen says how often would you apply microbial teas and again this is going to be general because there are different ones but just in general maybe something like recharge or great white in a five gallon pot how often would you apply that now I thought great white was a microisal product is it not me too it is typically you're putting on your roots or maybe they have a different for great white it's a direct application to the root system at an early stage of the plant's life because it's a microisal fungi it needs to form a symbiotic relationship with the plant's roots early on in the plant's life there's no point to top dressing it for recharge it's a consortium of microbes you could just follow the instructions on the label but essentially you could apply it weekly every two weeks once a cycle you're just trying to increase your nutrient cycling by adding microbes that are known to help with that process so there's no perfect application rate for something like recharge and then with great white or any micro product just use it early on coat the seed put it on the roots of your cuttings that's the time to use it cool wrap it up oh my gosh I missed 74 comments wow you guys are awesome I'll look forward to catching up with these here later and I really appreciate\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:00:53\n```\n short but yeah it was a lot of fun I loved all the interaction I appreciate everyone that tunes into this yeah thank you guys so much for participating and thank you for being here and being awesome to each other today we will do this again here in the near future so just stay tuned to both Kiss Organics YouTube channel and Chad Westport YouTube channel find our links down in the show notes and leave us any questions in the comments so thank you for joining us you guys have a good day see you later

I wanted to share this talk because I get a lot of questions about what inputs are safe to use in your garden. And I hear a lot of talk about this on social media, online, as well as in other groups. So this is a talk I put together for the Living Soil Summit this year in Prump, Nevada. And I wanted to re-record it here to share on YouTube. So the question I was looking at is what inputs are safe to use in your garden. There's a lot that goes into what products you choose to use to grow your plants with. And it's important to be thoughtful about those choices. So let's start by looking at some common agricultural fertilizers. The industrial meat industry is awful and there's no denying that. These animals are fed GMO grains and antibiotics or crops that have been sprayed with glyphosate, which is also roundup. Therefore these fertilizers will be contaminated with GMOs and antibiotics and pesticides and you're contaminating your crop when you use these inputs. In fact, blood meal, bone meal and feather meal are not truly organic. One could even say they're fake organic because they come from the waste streams of our industrial meat supply chain. So what are the alternatives? Amendments like fishbone meal or fish meal are much better because they're from the ocean. If you have a good source like wild caught fish then you're not utilizing, then you are utilizing cleaner amendments in your garden and you're not supporting the horrible meat industry and you're doing better by the environment. It's an all around win. Now that's a really compelling argument right there. It aligns with my values as someone who cares about organics and the environment. But what I want to do today is take a deeper look at these claims and see what research exists to either support or refute this idea. Let's talk about the conditions under which animals are raised in the meat industry. To be honest, they're not great. This to me is the best argument for not using these inputs. However, I also look at it from a sustainability perspective. If we know that these fertilizers are safe, that they're low and heavy metals, that they do not contain GMOs or pesticides and are very affordable, then it makes sense to me to be closing the loop. As realistically, they're not going any whether these waste products end up in compost, fertilizer, or even a landfill. And I know many folks in the room are into biomimicry, essentially doing what they think mother nature might do. And I can't think of anything more natural or a higher use than using a dead body to recycle the nutrients to grow something new. So what about the fishing industry? Is it superior to the meat industry? Well, most folks are familiar with the issues associated with farm fish. Farm fish are raised in high density conditions similar to the meat industry.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:03:02\n```\n to their diets. They make up more than half of the fish consumption within the United States. Between 70% and 80% of the seafood consumed in the United States is actually imported. But this is a bit of a misleading statistic because a portion of it is caught by American fishermen, exported overseas for processing, and then re-imported back into the US. And they use open net cages that can leach chemicals into the ocean, put in ocean wildlife at risk and damaging ecosystems, and farm fish have been known to escape their pens, which can spread disease to native populations because farm fish are regularly fed antibiotics because of their greater propensity for disease and parasites. Many farm fish are genetically modified as well and can contaminate native populations, like I mentioned above, and their waste can produce phytoplankton blooms, which destroy local ecology. So we can safely say that farm fish are not a reasonable alternative to the meat industry. So what about wild caught fish, then? You know, it's estimated that 80% of the world's natural fish stocks are fully to over exploited, depleted or in a state of collapse. Bycatch is a term referring to the unwanted fish or other marine catch creatures that are caught by commercial fishing practices. Sometimes the amount of bycatch that is captured, killed and discarded can be as high as 80% for certain fisheries. So this is something like if they are fishing for a particular fish species like salmon and they catch an octopus or some other animal, that would be considered bycatch. And scientists agree that at current exploitation levels that many important fish stocks will be removed from the system within 25 years. And lastly, there's a massive fossil fuel cost associated with wild caught fish, both in the fishing itself and then the transportation of the fish that import, exportation associated with processing that I mentioned before. So basically resources from the ocean can have negative impacts on our environment and challenges to sustainability as well. So I wanted to try and see what research there was out on this. So after a little bit of digging, I found a paper entitled Chemical Characterization of Commercial Organic Fertilizers by Kurt Mohler that was published in 2015 in the archives of agronomy and soil science. In this paper, the authors talk about how they're a wide range of commercial organic fertilizers, but not of a lot of research as to how heavy metals, organic pollutants like forever chemicals, PCBs, pesticides and antibiotic residues persist in these fertilizers and how much variation you might see in these fertilizers. And it took me a while to track down this paper as it wasn't easily accessible online, but it did appear to address some of the original idea of whether or not these fertilizers are safe or should be avoided for the reasons that I mentioned at the beginning of the talk.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:06:07\n```\n fertilizer samples across a range of products ranging from feather meal, bone meal, cocoa shells, clover grass, clover grass pellets, flax meal, corn gluten based fertilizers and many more. You can see the list here. They analyzed the material on a wide variety of parameters ranging from pH, EC, salt content, organic matter percentage, NPK, trace minerals, along with heavy metals, pesticides, antibiotics, GMOs and PCBs, those forever chemicals. Here's some of what they found and feel free to pause it if you want to go back and look at the data. But depending on the product, they essentially found varying levels of heavy metals based on the product source. Basically, all the fertilizers had some levels of heavy metals, though many were below the detection limits of the equipment used in the study. And here's some more of that information relating to organic persistent pollutant content and the number of positive tests for salmonella and pesticides in these fertilizers. So I wanted to highlight some of the author's comments and notes in the study as they're related to the safety of these different fertilizers. And here they state, the concentration of persistent organic pollutants was close to the detection limit on a very low level for all sample fertilizers. So basically, all the fertilizers had very, very low levels of these PCBs. So there wasn't a big difference between whether they were plant based or meat based, but they were low across the board. So that's a relatively good sign in saying that from a perspective of PCBs, pretty much all these fertilizers were safe. Antibiotic compounds were not found and all the samples were GMO free. I think this is an important statement because some of the argument I've been hearing against using some of these fertilizers is that they're going to be tainted with antibiotics and GMOs. And that just simply wasn't the case in the study based on all the samples that they took of, you know, specifically the blood meal and the bone meal. And only some residues, a few pesticides were found in the few ways of the food processing industry, including the malt calms, residues of the corn, maize processing, grape pomace, cocoa shells and potato peels. So the only fertilizers that had any pesticide residue were actually the plant based ones, which makes sense. So pesticides is not a concern with the bone meal or blood meal as well. Here's another, here's another section that I thought was really interesting. So the toxic element contents of most sampled commercial organic fertilizers were low compared to values found for source separated organic urban waste compost or digest dates, poultry manure manure or other livestock manures. So\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:09:12\n```\n fertilizers are much lower in heavy metals compared to your compost source. Specifically, they single out poultry manure or other livestock manures down below. But essentially, most of these animal based compost are probably a much greater risk for bringing in all of the things that we talked about at the beginning of this talk, then your fertilizer. However, there were some exceptions. There was high cadmium content in the waste of the corn maize, the maize corn processing probably related to high cadmium contents in the soil. So for any plant based fertilizer, if that plant has the ability to take up those heavy metals, and there's heavy metals in the soil that it's grown in, it could potentially be contaminated. And that's something to consider as well. But there wasn't high cadmium content in the bone meal or the blood meal or any of the meat based one. Now there was high lead contents in horn and hooves, which could be related to contamination during the product drying process using open fires in the source countries. So the way that they, the authors suspected the way that that product, the horn and hooves product was processed is actually what's leading to the high lead, not necessarily the initial parent material that was used to make it the horns and hooves themselves. And the high toxic element in micronutrient contents in the potato peel based fertilizer might be related to higher concentration of these elements in the potato skin and the nutrient grading of these elements from the periphery towards the center of the tuber. So the idea here being that the skin of the potato contained higher levels or higher concentrations of toxic elements, so in this case, heavy metals or micronutrients, then the actual flesh of the of the potato, as well as potentially some soil residues adhering to the skin of the potatoes from processing if that soil had higher levels of micronutrients or heavy metals. And then the low micronutrient content in animal fertilizers derived from slaughterhouse activities was likewise noteworthy. So they tend to be primarily just containing those macronutrients listed above. They don't have a lot of micronutrient content, which is fine because that's something that we can always pick up another way. So the measured contamination of the sampled commercial organic fertilizers with organic pollutants was several orders of magnitude lower than the values reported for organic urban waste compost. Again, I just want to highlight it compost is probably a much bigger risk and source of contamination in your garden than any of these commercial fertilizers. They also state that the lack of any contamination with antibiotic compounds in fertilizers derived from animal slaughterhouses is surprising as application of antibiotic compounds has often become a replied procedure in conventional animal husbandry in the\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:12:17\n```\n fact that many of these animals were probably treated with antibiotics, but they were not finding any actual antibiotic compounds in the feather meal, fish or feather meal, bone meal, blood meal, the ones associated with the study. However, only the minor ratio of the supplied antibiotic compounds is adsored by the animals 40 to 90% is excreted by animal feces. Therefore, the highest pollution risk with antibiotic residues can be expected in livestock manures as confirmed by several studies. So this makes total sense this idea that antibiotics are ending up in your blood meal or bone meal is it doesn't seem to be the case. Really, those things are moving through the animal systems just like with humans and ending up in the waste products. So it's really this poultry manure, compost or maybe poultry manure fertilizer, as well as cow manure horse manure where you'd want to be more concerned with antibiotics and you may want to look for an organic source input source to avoid antibiotic contamination. And now contamination with pesticide residues was only found in waste with a low level of processing like the grape, the malt and the cocoa shells and many of the compounds found are used during the storage of feedstock materials. So they may have been treated with insecticides while they were being stored and made the detected residues of insecticides belong to pyrethroids and they list below and and some even a fungicide in the case of the grape pomace. So again, this plant based fertilizers were more likely to have pesticide or fungicidal contamination. There was none found in any of the meat based products. And most of the commercial organic fertilizers were derived from a very complex industrial processes, including heating and drying at the end of the processes. Essentially, this leads to de facto pasteurization. So this pasteurization is going to kill off salmonella, E. coli and a lot of these pathogens as very few are able to survive pasture the pasteurization process. And so then they stayed there for the hygienic status of most of the commercial organic fertilizers derived from these complex processes in the food industry can be assessed as high. There was one sample of bone meal that tested positive for salmonella probably resulting from a reinfection after the heat treatment. So there may have been something in that particular process that allowed for there to be potentially indicator bacteria for salmonella in it. Now, what about mad cows disease? This is another thing I've heard associated with risks with using bone meal. And I would state that with any organic fertilizer that we're putting out, one should use proper PPE and in the case of things that are dusty, like even alfalfa meal, for example, you should wear a mask or\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:15:21\n```\n lungs, especially so though with these animal based ones, because there are things called prions, which are resistant to heat and normal sterilization processes that can make it through this whole process that we just talked about. And there were four deaths in Great Britain in the mid 90s from using bone meal from cattle that had mad cows disease. But they banned in 1970s 1997, the FDA banned using protein made from ruminants like cows fed to other ruminants like pigs. And the primary source is in commercial feed of cattle to to an infectious source. Now, one thing I learned that I wasn't aware of is that mad cows disease occurs spontaneously at very low levels in all cattle populations, but only five cases have ever been have discovered and reported in the United States ever. So it's happening at a very low level. And it's a very low risk. So you're I would think that eating eating meat, in a lot of cases, if you're eating anything that has may can potentially contain brain or spinal cord tissue, that's a much higher risk than using bone meal in your product. But I just didn't want to address that because it is something that people bring up as a potential risk. But I in terms of the risk level of it, I just want to state that it appears to be fairly low. So what about blood meal? This was another interesting one because I saw on a website from a popular company stating that blood meal is full of antibiotics and pathogens. And so I wanted to research this because that to me is pretty scary. And I don't want to use anything like that. So I did I wasted a good morning one day before the summit, trying to find anything on Google Scholar that related to blood meal containing pathogens containing antibiotics, or anything about blood meals a fertilizer that might relate to this. And I was unable to find any research to support these claims. In fact, it was only listed on this one website, which I think it's been subsequently removed now. And one other website that used it as a citation to spread this message. And this was I list I show you here one of the web, the two websites I mentioned. So what I want to say is there's no research that I've been able to find to support this claim. And it would go directly against the study that I mentioned in this in this talk. And manure based compost and commercial organic fertilizers may be way more problematic than your blood meal. One paper found I found showed that repeated applications of chicken or swine pig based manure, in fertilizers increased antibiotic levels and soils, but then most of it dissipated over the course of a couple months, but not completely. So\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:18:23\n```\n persisting terribly long in the soil, which I thought was was interesting enough to share. These antibiotics are poorly absorbed and metabolized so much of it is inscreted in the waste of animals and humans. And there's very little research on the impact of veterinary antibiotics on soil ecosystems unfortunately. So what if we want to avoid animals or fish altogether or look in the alternative options in the ones I've already mentioned? What about what about neem then? Well, neem has a massive fossil fuel costs relative to other products. You know, we're shipping it all the way from India. It has the potential for heavy metals and pesticide residues even on organic products. I've mentioned this before on the podcast and other talks where my friend Suzanne Wainwright Evans had worked with a farm who had failed for a chemistry of pesticides that's no longer allowed for use in the United States and hasn't been allowed since the 70s. And they tracked it down after their cannabis crop failing, unfortunately, they tracked it down to the neem oil product they were using. And so essentially that neem seed meal had been crushed, the oil had been extracted, and there was enough residue of pesticides had been sprayed onto that neem tree that it made it into the oil and then contaminated the product. So basically, the point is neem is not a perfect option or solution either. So what about soft rock phosphates? Well, it's a mined product. So it's going to contain heavy metals. There's really no way around that. And it has large fossil fuel costs, not only the mining process itself, but the transportation of the product. So you know, there may be mines that are cleaner in other countries outside of North America. But the cost to get that product here is a massive fossil fuel cost that one should account for when considering what products they want to use in their garden, if you want to be ecological and sustainable. Same goes for guanos, you know, they work, but large fossil fuel costs associated with them, they're harvested overseas. They damage the local ecology without harvesting in many cases. And they're not sustainable. So what are more sustainable options or alternatives? How about alfalfa meal? alfalfa meal has massive water requirements. Now don't get me wrong, I love alfalfa meal. It's something that I use in almost every garden prescription that I make. But it has a relatively low NPK, it requires a lot of water to grow it. It is a wonderful microbial source, but it's not perfect. And I guess that's the point I really want to make. So if we want to talk about, you know, sustainability, then we really have to look at reducing our\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:21:28\n```\n cultivate with fewer inputs and not falling for the marketing around hype products, or things in the bottles that we may really not need. And so if we want to talk about sustainability, insect frass, to me is really one of the most sustainable nutrient sources available on the market today. Unfortunately, though, it does have limited sources and it has variable quality. But it is the most sustainable option for closing a loop in our food supply because we can feed our food waste to these insects, they can process it, and then they're essentially their manure tends to be very clean. It tends to be have contained good microbial activity and biomass. And it tends to be a pretty good product. Well, what about compost and manures? Those are also a great option. However, they can contain plastics, antibiotics, pesticides and pathogens. So really, if we want to talk about what I mean, if we want to look at what's organic and what's fake organic, truly our compost and manures have much, much more risk associated with them and much more contamination associated with them. And I think that's just something that we need to recognize when we're making a decision in our garden. And I say this, as someone who loves compost, highly advocates for compost, we just need to be careful with it and not demonize certain products over other products based on an agenda that may or may not be accurate. Compost is probably going to contain heavy metals, so we need to use it sparingly if we're in a regulated state, or if that the compost inputs contain heavy metals. And ultimately, where we land is trying to source things locally. And so even folks that purchase soil from us that we ship to them, we then try to work with them to use the fewest number of inputs as possible in order to grow healthy products and try and source things as much as they can locally. Now, the limitations with locally sourcing things is limited options. You may not be able to get all of the products you want or clean versions of those products locally. And that's just the reality of the situation. And that may lead you to having to purchase some things online and have them shipped to you. But the best thing that we can do is reuse our soil and reduce our inputs while maintaining fertility. And the point of this whole talk is really not to say that like one input is better than another. I'm not here to say that blood meal or bone meal or feather meal are superior to fish bone meal or fish meal or other sources. You know, I could have made the same talk around mine products like rock dust or peat moss versus cocoa core or just about any other input in our garden. I wanted to put together this talk as a way to have encouraging growers to think critically and separate out a marketing\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:24:31\n```\n are crafted to sell you products by allowing a company to differentiate themselves around the message. And sometimes these messages or concepts can be really powerful because they tug on our emotions or fit with our values. But when you dig just a little bit deeper, the reality of it can be entirely different. So in closing, I want to challenge you to think critically and deeply about how you cultivate this plant. Be open minded to new ideas, but also do your own research and don't accept anything that you hear at face value, regardless of how authoritative or knowledgeable this person may be or how many followers they may have on social media. So whether you practice Jadam or KNF or biodynamics or social food web, at the end of the day, there's wisdom and misinformation in every one of these methods. It wasn't until my good friend Tim Wilson called me out about some things that I was saying about compost tea that I heard from the foremost expert in the industry and challenged me to test it out for myself that I became a more critical thinker and it made me a better grower. You can always trial new ideas or products in a test plot in your garden too if you make a hypothesis and take a scientific approach. At the end of the day though, regardless of what method you use or what amendments you choose to use in your garden, there's a million ways to grow this plant. And as long as you're being thoughtful and with an eye towards sustainability, then it's all good in my book. Thanks for checking out this talk. Please reach out if you have any questions. I really appreciate it.", "id": "3d66a21b-11fa-4334-909a-2aba98bbb643"}

Three pounds per acre is considered sufficient by most agronomists. More than four pounds of boron (2 ppm) in the same volume of soil can be toxic to a few crop species, but is comfortable for most. My main goal regarding boron levels is for everyone to have a good result \u2014 and be safe at the same time. At worst, mild excesses will leach out in a few years. I can tell you this: If there is boron toxicity, the first crop to show it will be green beans. Celery, potato, tomato, radish, corn, pumpkin, peppers (and chilies), sweet potato and lima beans are in the \u201csemitolerant,\u201d group, meaning they can take only so much boron, and then they get in trouble. Because fertilizers can so easily be double applied (or more than that), this book specifies boron applications be limited to two pounds per acre. If the soil called for that much it would be possible to put in another two pounds of boron one month after the first amendment, but generally, two pounds of boron in one year is more than sufficient to feed soil and hopefully increase the boron level next year.

No part of this ebook may be copied or sold. 150 The Intelligent Gardener though boron is applied in minute quantities, it is easy enough to uni\u0002formly spread boron all by itself because borax is readily soluble. If you dissolved 20 grams (roughly one heaping tablespoon) of laundry borax into one quart of hot water, and sprayed that water fairly uniformly on the soil of a 100-square-foot bed, you\u2019d be applying 2 pounds per acre actual boron. That concentration will not damage leaves, but to be effective, boron must go into the soil. It is poorly used by plants when sprayed as foliar fertilizer. Even though it\u2019s powerful stuff for the amount needed, please don\u2019t be scared of boron. It has a unique and vitally important job to do. The minuscule tubes that plants use to conduct moisture must be lined with boron. If these tubes don\u2019t get enough boron, they don\u2019t function effectively, which means the plant can\u2019t drink effectively, which means it can\u2019t nourish itself effectively. As Hugh Lovel, a biodynamic soil con\u0002sultant puts it: boron comes first, and then come the rest of the plant nutrients. A plant\u2019s vascular tubes are also the lodging point for much of the plant\u2019s acquisition of silicon. Boron and silicon work together at an atomic level to move moisture up these minute tubes. Silicon, yet another anion, is one vital plant nutrient that is not yet appreciated by most soil analysts and so is not routinely tested for, and there are few soil amendments sold specifically to raise silicon supplies in soil. However, soft rock phosphate usually contains a good deal of silicon. Silicon is one element where SaMOA won\u2019t hurtcha.

But, pushing soil phosphorus levels well beyond sufficiency seems highly desirable to me, despite the cost. Certainly you do not want low phosphorus! Phosphorus determines the speed at which plants grow because it is a key part of all cellular enzymes, including those that liberate and transfer cellular energy. I like this analogy: If you lower the voltage (less P), the motor doesn\u2019t spin as rapidly. The most confusing thing about phosphorus nutrition is that when plants are short P, they usually manifest no obvious symptoms other than slower growth (something home gardeners can rarely gauge), leading to a smaller ultimate yield of lower nutritional quality and poorer flavor. Yes, when phosphorus is catastrophically short, the plant may turn purple and be obviously distressed, but even slight deficiencies immediately reduce growth rates. Of this, Carey who doctored soils and wrote books about it, said: The factor which determines the mineral content in any produce, whether it is a grass, or anything else, is the phosphate in the soil. The higher the water-soluble phosphate, the higher the mineral content. In order to get the maximum amount of nutrient in the crop, and the maximum yield, a minimum of 400 lbs. per acre of available phosphate is needed. That much cannot be supplied from superphosphate, triple superphosphate, or hard rock phosphate. Soft rock phosphate is the best way to achieve this level, besides its having many other benefits. (source: customers.hbci.com/~cmills/ PHOSPHATE%20Reams.html, accessed July 7, 2012) I point out Reams said \u201cavailable phosphate,\u201d not available phosphorus. And I remind you that P = 0.044 x P2O5. One hundred seventy-five pounds of elemental phosphorus per acre is a gracious plenty. With enough organic matter present, it is possible to usefully apply 175 pounds of available P on very light soils. Really heavy soils can, and should, hold up to 500 and some pounds of P. I\u2019ve been stressing the importance of phosphorus because this is one nutrient people are tempted to cut corners on. Phosphorus is costly when supplied at luxury levels, and plants seem to do fine with far less of it than what it takes to produce real nutrient-density. Phosphorus is increasingly scarce. The planet is experiencing peak phosphorus in much the same way we have passed the point of peak oil production. The price is inevitably going to go up, and then it is going to go up some more. Despite the cost involved, I urge you to bring your gardens to the highest useful level. Few farmers fully remineralize phosphorus, or any other element for that matter. In fact, farmers have been mostly running phosphate mines and calling them grain fields. Farmers often supply only the amount of P sufficient for the crop being grown. Gardeners, on the other hand, are not dealing with acres by the hundreds or thousands;  they are dealing with a few hundred or a few thousand square feet. And what if it does cost us a few dollars more to produce our food? Compared to the supermarket price, no matter what the cost of our inputs, home-garden produce still comes out far cheaper in dollar terms. If nutrient-density is considered, comparing the monetary cost of production means nothing. This year, I purchased a ton of Queensland soft rock phosphate (SRP) in sacks. The price was about A$800 in Queensland, plus freight to Tasmania. (At the time I am writing this, the Aussie dollar is about par with the US dollar.) Queensland SRP assays at 8.8% elemental phosphorus, so one ton contains 176 pounds of elemental phosphorus. Forget the cost of freight. Forget that it was a metric ton, so it\u2019s weight actually was 2,200 pounds. If this had been a farm-scale purchase, a full shipping container of unbagged SRP could have cost me less than $600/ton, delivered. This year. Next year, it probably will cost more. A century ago, the furrowslice acre of an average North American farm, in an area where the evapotranspiration ratio was over 100, held 2,000\u20135,000 pounds of elemental phosphorus. Once. Originally, the biological processes in that average farm soil released more than sufficient phosphate during the growing season. But soil erosion and crop removals have taken away so much of that original endowment and so weakened the soil\u2019s microlife that now the farmer must use phosphate fertilizer with every crop. An acre of grain sends 20\u201340 pounds of elemental P through the farm gate. If a farm was put into production 100 years ago, and 20 lbs/P/ac/year has been taken away ever since, then over the past century something like 2,000 pounds of P per acre have mostly gone down various outhouses and sewerage systems (unless the grain was fed to farm animals). It might seem that removing 2,000 pounds of phosphorus from a soil that held little more than that amount to begin with might not leave enough to allow it to continue to produce crops. Keep in mind that I was referring only to what was originally present in the average topsoil, not to what accessible treasures might lie below that level. The average farmer in this scenario probably applied some phosphorus fertilizer in the past decades, but the cropping system lowered the soil\u2019s organic matter levels. This hugely reduced the soil\u2019s anion exchange capacity, and down went the phosphorus level. I consider the removed fertility as an off-balance-sheet national debt owed until repaid \u2014 hopefully not with too much karmic interest attached. And what would the dollar price be for the 2,000 pounds of P, not counting the other minerals that also departed? Well, in the form of bagged soft rock phosphate delivered to Steve Solomon\u2019s property, the bill at this year\u2019s price would come to about $10,000. Per acre. And that\u2019s just for the P that has been extracted. I have just demonstrated why a deeply debt-enslaved farmer cannot give up soil mining. Nor could a free-and-clear farmer consider full remineralization because they, too, must sell to a market in which the price is determined by soil miners. But if you are intending to remineralize a really big veggie garden, say an eighth-acre garden, then instead of confronting a $10,000 per acre phosphorus debt, you\u2019re looking at $1,200. But the debt of all that lost phosphorus could not possibly be repaid at one go, even if you wanted to. If you put in a gracious plenty of phosphorus with every crop and build your soil organic matter, then the soil background levels will gradually build back up until they reach target for that TCEC. Then you can stop adding phosphorus, probably for a decade or two. A classic book about the economics of farm remineralization is The Story of the Soil by Cyril Hopkins (1903). It is about an intelligent young man looking to buy an exhausted farm in Virginia on the cheap. He fully considers the cost of remineralizing that land using rock phosphate and lime. Hopkins knew the whole story a century ago. You can download the book for free; full details are in the Bibliography. So what is the best overall strategy to build P? First, increase the anion exchange capacity. If the phosphorus you add gets hooked up with humus or comes already as a part of manure or compost, it will remain available for a long time \u2014 maybe 20 years, maybe 100 years. But if P fails to connect with humus, then it will almost inevitably hook up with calcium or worse, with iron. It will become one of the insoluble forms of calcium phosphate, or the extremely insoluble iron phosphate. And if this happens, your expensive P will invisibly merge into the soil\u2019s background reserve. Only a tiny fraction of that reserve will be available on next year\u2019s soil audit. Once the reserve is large enough, there will be plenty of available phosphorus. Someday, you may be able to reduce phosphorus additions to the small amounts crops actually remove each year. However, most soil advisors say when you add 10 pounds of available phosphate to a soil that is very low in phosphate, you\u2019ll be lucky to find 1 pound added to the level on next year\u2019s test report. But the relationship improves over time. As the soil becomes more saturated, a larger proportion of applied phosphorus sticks. However, take heart: those soil advisors are not dealing with garden soils carrying 5% or 7% organic matter. Without a limit of 175 pounds per acre per single addition, complying with P = K could prove extremely wasteful. And for sure, 175 pounds is generous. It makes sense to spread P with generosity because ultimately you will use less fertilizer than if you gave the soil just a little more than the current crop needs. Suppose your target level is 335 lbs in the top six inches of an acre (you\u2019re working with a soil having a TCEC of 12.0). You have the type of ordinary, maybe average soil, often seen. Suppose that soil has almost no available phosphorus, another thing often seen. If the cost of elemental P is US$5 a pound, then 335 pounds of P costs about US$1,600 as soft rock phosphate, which would mean about US$200 for an eighth-acre veggie plot. If money is abundant, you could start by adding 335 lb/ac, and then, as the starting level came up, you could feed slightly less phosphorus every year until eventually the spring soil audit approached 335 pounds. Actually, our hypothetical soil would inevitably be quite low in organic matter as well as phosphate, but since this is all imaginary anyway, suppose it had quite high organic matter level, just no P. In that case, much of your expensive 335 pounds of P might stick. Vegetable Phosphorus Target Level is P = K. Single applications are limited to 175 pounds per acre. Matthew\u2019s target is 350 pounds per acre. He has excess P.  crops growing on light soil that is well below phosphorus targets will do quite well if their soil is fed even an additional 100 lb/ac of actual phosphorus (230 lb/ac phosphate). However, when you retest that soil a year later, the background levels may not have increased by much at all. But if you\u2019ll apply a generous 175 lb/ac to that soil, you\u2019ll get a great crop and see some meaningful build-up next spring. You can marry phosphate fertilizers into compost and thereby make a far larger percentage of composted rock phosphate become available. Already part of organic matter the phosphorus remains available so your levels will build up faster.", "id": "3072be22-27e4-4445-8d39-4fccd6ca1655"}

The sulfur is converted into amino acids or enzymes with the primary function being to aid in the reduction conversion of nitrates into proteins and amino acids. Consequently, sulfur deficiencies look a lot like nitrogen deficiencies but are not as dramatic as a nitrogen deficiency. Plants are generally smaller and lighter in color.\n\n(Steve Solomon - the intelligent gardener)\n\nSulfur, in partnership with nitrogen, forms key pieces in several essential amino acids and crucial enzymes. When sulfur is abundant, these are plentiful; in consequence, the plant is able to form a broader range of proteins. Flavor is more abundant and so is nutrient-density. When sulfur is short, plant proteins are less complete and have lower feeding value. Sulfur has long been used as a fungicide; ground to fine powder, it is dusted on plants to prevent or fend off diseases. I suspect much of the reason sulfur works to fight disease is because the diseased plants were seriously short S in the first place. A few decades ago, most of North America received an ongoing acid rain sulfur hit from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels. Now, acid rain has largely been cleaned up by environmental legislation, so farmers have to pay attention to getting sulfur into their fields. So must you. Putting high levels of S into topsoil leaches out cations. This leaching is not necessarily something to be avoided. When sulfur merges into the soil solution, it takes the form of the sulfate anion, SO4\u20132. Sulfur Target S = \u00bd Mg until there are no more cation excesses. Then: S = 1/3 P. Or, if you want to improve your subsoil, S = \u00bd Mg. \nWhen you till in raw sulfur, which is an excellent fertilizer, albeit a bit harsh, it is converted to sulfate ions by soil bacteria. Every combina\u0002tion with sulfate I know of is highly soluble in water: iron sulfate, zinc, copper and manganese sulfates, potassium sulfate, etc. Even uranium sulfate is water soluble. Calcium sulfate (gypsum) is also soluble, but not quite so readily as the others. Should too much rain or irrigation flow through the soil, it can leach sulfates. Thus, having high sulfur levels results in a steady (slow) reduction of nutrient levels in the topsoil. Farmers, counting the bottom line, have to work hard to keep costly fertilizers in the topsoil, so they might not want more S present than what is sufficient for the crop. The sulfate anion\u2019s ability to connect with cations and keep them in soluble form is why this book specifies a high level of sulfur when there are excess cations to leach out. Subsoils Slow leaching can provide the garden a huge benefit. If you have a subsoil that is capable of holding onto cations, then what you leach out of the topsoil can be captured and retained there. If what leaches down is balanced nutrition, then your subsoil will be enormously improved thereby. Subsoils in the eastern United States and Canada are usually more acidic than their topsoil is. Most are nearly pure clay that originally formed in the topsoil and then was transported into the subsoil by water and deposited there. Subsoils tend naturally to be airless because they are far from being saturated by calcium; their clays are packed so tightly that no roots could breathe in them \u2014 even if there weren\u2019t toxic levels of manganese and/or aluminum, which is usually the case. Skip ahead and look at Figure 5.5. It is a chart that saves me a thousand words of description and deserves several meditations on your part. It shows how nutrient availability changes with soil pH. Manganese, an important nutrient, becomes 100 times more available at pH 5.0 than it is at 6.0 (and it is also toxic at those concentrations). An even worse problem under acidic conditions is the increased availability of aluminum. Even extremely low levels of soluble aluminum are highly poisonous to plants. Fortunately, aluminum is almost entirely insoluble at pH levels over 5.0. But few plants can tolerate the amount of aluminum available when pH is below 5.0. \n\n Gardeners imagine that vegetables root only in the topsoil; this is not true. An agricultural scientist named John Weaver found that most species form root systems at least four and even six feet deep on Nebraska prairie soils (which have relatively open, non-acidic, free-draining subsoils, well supplied with air). When the same varieties were grown in New York State, where there was an acidic clay subsoil, they made root systems only about two feet deep. (If you\u2019re interested in learning more, Weaver\u2019s classic book is Root Development of Vegetable Crops is available for free download at soilandhealth.org.) But, I\u2019d bet that if Weaver had amended his Nebraska land with gyp\u0002sum at a ton or two per acre for a few years prior to growing those vegetables, his team would have found roots going even deeper, and they would have been far more densely developed. It won\u2019t be too many more pages before you fully understand why gypsum will cause that sort of transformation. And I\u2019ll give you a theory: That field in New York that grew a few of Weaver\u2019s vegetables with restricted root systems\u2026I bet that before the original old-growth forest had been cleared, the subsoil was not impervious to root penetration. For the first years that field was used for farming, its subsoil remained open to root penetration, which is why yields were so large in those early days, and the food grown was nutrient-dense. But the subsoil was gradually robbed of minerals, until it became too acidic for crops to root into it any longer. Tiedjens tells us of another way subsoils were wrecked by farming; this type won\u2019t have an acid pH, even if they are in a climate that normally has acidic soils. When potassium chloride (KCl) is heavily used as fertilizer (which it was and still is), the intense flush of potassium being released knocks some calcium cations off the exchange points; these combine with the chloride, forming calcium chloride (CaCl2), a highly soluble substance that is easily leached. In short, for every unit of KCl spread on the topsoil, a goodly amount of CaCl2 leaches into the groundwater. As the subsoil becomes depleted of calcium, its exchange points get filled with potassium. Thus saturated, the subsoil is not acidic; in fact, since potassium raises pH more than calcium does, it will be slightly alkaline. But it will contain so little calcium that roots cannot grow there. For all intents, that subsoil is dead. \n \n Remineralizing the subsoil by digging lime and other fertilizers directly into it would be an exhausting task if done with a spade and wheelbarrow. I\u2019ve always wondered why those intensive organic gardening books so glibly recommend putting in SaMOA two feet deep. Well, just you try to double-dig your way through a gooey clay subsoil. Just try! But there\u2019s an easy solution. Allow elemental sulfur in the topsoil to hook up with a good bit of calcium if there\u2019s an excess of it, or else add gypsum \u2014 calcium sulfate \u2014 and cause those elements to naturally leach down into that acidic clay. As the subsoil gradually becomes filled with cations, especially with calcium, its acidity will moderate, or its potassium excess may be reduced, which may allow root penetration. When setting food-garden sulfur targets, the fundamental questions are: Are you planning on using that land long term? Do you want to remineralize only the topsoil or remineralize the topsoil and eventually, gradually, the subsoil? You\u2019ll still get a decent, nutrient-dense crop without bothering about subsoil. But you\u2019ll get far better long-term results if you can improve subsoil conditions. The deeper the roots can go, the larger and healthier the plant will grow. Plants with accessible subsoil can grow larger than most gardeners think is possible. Plants on deep, open soil get enough elbow room to achieve extraor\u0002dinary size without getting stressed by having to compete too much. This means fruit-bearing crops like pole beans, cucumbers, zucchini and tomato do not necessarily have their yield taper off after an ini\u0002tial burst; instead, the yield keeps on increasing as the plant keeps on growing. This approach is the opposite of intensive gardening, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve encouraged for many a decade. An open subsoil also makes the garden far more drought-proof because there normally are huge reserves of moisture in subsoil clay \u2014 if only the plants can establish roots in it. And wouldn\u2019t it be fine to leave your land more productive than you found it? So why not dig yourself a three-foot-deep hole in your garden and make the acquaintance of your subsoil, if you have one. This is most easily done with a soil augur of the sort used to set fence posts. To get three feet down, you may need to extend the augur\u2019s shaft; this isn\u2019t difficult. Otherwise, believe me, the result is worth an hour of pick-and-shovel work. The subsoil may look like gooey, airless stuff with no sign of root penetration anywhere, but it might be fixable. And what if, to your delight, you find your subsoil ain\u2019t that bad, and you find some grass roots a yard deep? In either case, be a big spender; run two standard 20-buck soil tests using a 12-inch sample depth. Take one sample in the top foot of soil; the other sample in the next foot down. If you manage to dig as far as the third foot, be a bigger spender and sample the third foot, too. If you\u2019re not in the humid Southeast of the United States, where most of the clays are old and tired, and if you are east of the 98th Meridian, you might be surprised to find your subsoil clay has an astonishingly high TCEC. Like 50 or 60. If you\u2019re over 100 on the evapotranspiration map and not in limestone country, it will be acidic \u2014 around pH 4.5. The aluminum level may be way too high. And there may be toxic levels of manganese, too. Now, take another look at Figure 5.5 and imagine what that clay could be if you managed to even partially saturate and somewhat balance its huge TCEC and thereby get the pH up to a comfortable range. If you live where the evapotranspiration ratio is under 100 but over 60, you may not have a clay subsoil at all. Instead, the same stuff making up the topsoil will be found in the subsoil too, although the percentage of clay in it will be higher than it is in the topsoil. I expect the soil in which John Weaver\u2019s students exposed the finest details of plant root development by gently toothbrushing away the soil was of that sort. These kinds of subsoils are worthy of great investment, especially when all you have to do is to remove some of that magnesium and/or potassium, replace it with calcium, and thereby open up another foot or two of soil to root penetration. For my retirement, the Universe seems to have gifted me with a subsoil like that. Suppose you are living on a glacial moraine, such as the sand hills of western Washington State or the Kootenays in British Columbia (two similar locales I know well from having lived there). As you dig four feet or even ten feet into your coarse sandy soil, you\u2019d find only more coarse sand and rounded glacial rocks. There is nothing down there capable of holding cations, so encouraging valuable plant nutrients to leach into that subsoil would be pointless. Your evaluation may be quick and easy if your garden has only a foot or two of topsoil, with solid rock below. In that case, there\u2019s no sense having valuable plant nutrients sliding along that interface between soil and rock, heading downhill on a subterranean journey to the ocean. There\u2019s another reason to get into communication with your subsoil. If you happen to have a sandy garden with a clay subsoil, and that clay just happens to have a high cation exchange capacity (20 to 80), then you will be able to make far better compost if you add one or two percent (by starting volume) of that high-cation-exchange-capacity clay to it. Clay like that is almost entirely missing from your topsoil; it\u2019s already been transported into the subsoil. And such clay won\u2019t be found for sale on the shelves of garden centers in a convenient dry powder form. But if you have some good clay already on hand, if all you have to do is to dig a deep hole and there it is, a bit of clay mining is worth considering. And speaking of being a law-abiding citizen, did you ever see exposures of clay along minor highways?", "id": "591c7a3f-c74d-46e8-bbee-8a748178cc06"}

He highlighted why he thinks apple growers know the most about Calcium in plant nutrition, because they have to deal with bitter pit in apple cultivation. Bitter pit, a disorder linked to calcium deficiency, resulted in significant crop losses for apple growers, at times around 50%. To combat this, growers implemented foliar calcium feeding, a costly and labor-intensive method. This approach significantly reduced the incidence of bitter pit.  After adopting calcium foliar feeding, these rates improved dramatically to 95%. This change represented a substantial financial gain, amounting to millions of dollars.\n\nBryant thinks cannabis growers need to think about the number of shoots that are actively growing and the rate at which they're growing.  He notes that new shoots require a tremendous amount of calcium, emphasizing the importance of managing the number and growth rate of these shoots. In apple production,  they're actually summer pruning to prevent too many growing shoots, because when you have too many growing shoots, it's an enormous calcium requirement for the plant. \n\nBryant's discussion on calcium uptake highlights its dependence on the plant's transpiration process. Transpiration, the movement of water through a plant from roots to leaves, plays a critical role in calcium transport. As water moves up through the xylem, it carries calcium along with it. This process underscores the importance of maintaining a consistent flow of water and calcium, especially during the vegetative stage. Adequate calcium in this stage sets the foundation for the plant's overall health, yield, and disease resistance.\n\nHe contrasts calcium sulfate (gypsum) and potassium sulfate, noting gypsum's lower solubility limits its impact on soil pH and sulfur levels. In contrast, potassium sulfate, with its higher solubility, can significantly increase sulfur concentration in the soil, potentially leading to issues. He emphasizes that while gypsum does not lead to excessive sulfur, potassium sulfate used in high quantities will cause a pH imbalance.  Potassium sulfate, with its higher solubility, can significantly increase sulfur concentration in the soil, potentially leading to issues. \n\nBesides gypsum, other forms of Calcium we can get in the soil includes lime, dolomite, and wollastonite.  Bryant wanted to discuss wollastonite because it is the least expensive source of silica and silica can be highly beneficial.  Wollastonite is effective for slightly increasing soil pH and providing cost-effective, plant-available silica. It has a slower dissolution rate than lime, offering better buffering against rapid pH drops caused by factors like water acidity or organic acids. Unlike lime, which can rapidly neutralize acidity leading to sharp pH declines, wollastonite's buffering action is more gradual. This property is beneficial for managing soil pH stability over time, particularly in environments with fluctuating acidity levels.", "id": "79925107-b3a3-4d21-9736-777bb5dea09d"}

Bryant doesn't see too much sulfur in the soil.  If there was, the risk is  osmotic shock or osmotic pressure in the soil due to salt stress. So all of these things that we're talking about are salts.  If you drop potassium sulfate in the soil solution, it'll dissolve up to over 400 grams per gallon of water compared to gypsum, which is only like eight or nine grams per gallon of water. So the solubility of that potassium sulfate molecule is just so much higher than the calcium sulfate molecule that it will release more ions into the solution. The sulfur is the same. I mean, it's the same thing, but you just get such a higher concentration of it that the EC, the soluble salts, the osmotic stress, those are all somewhat synonymous. You will see the sulfur on a tissue test be toward the high end of the sufficiency range or even out of the sufficiency range, but I don't think there's any issue with that. There's no antagonisms with other anions. I guess we're getting into more of the realm of anecdotes here, but some growers, well, there's two things that I've heard from growers. One of them is a myth, in my opinion, and that's that sulfur levels like that kill soil biology. And I just don't think there's any evidence of that. Soil microbes need sulfur and there are certain populations or certain species that actually prefer high sulfur environments. You'll see a shift in the population profile like you will with any management action that you take, but it definitely doesn't kill microbes.   There's something called the Bordeaux mixture or lime sulfur. It's a great fungicide when topically applied to the leaves, but it's completely different chemistry in those products versus sulfur in the soil. At 100 ppm, it's not toxic.

Living soils, often enriched with compost and organic amendments, possess a natural buffering capacity against pH fluctuations.

The role of water in soil pH is complex; its impact is determined not just by the pH but also by the water's alkalinity. High alkalinity can influence soil pH over time, necessitating adjustments to maintain optimal soil conditions for plant health. This highlights the importance of regular soil testing and a nuanced approach to water management, especially in regions with extreme water qualities.  pH management involves choosing the right soil amendments. Liquid potassium additives, often used for increasing pH, add potassium to the system. Alternatively, alkaline calcium amendments like wollastonite and oyster shell, both primarily calcium carbonate, offer different rates of pH adjustment due to their composition. The effectiveness of amendments like crushed eggshells, which are less soluble and decompose slowly in soil, highlights the importance of selecting amendments based on their solubility and composition for effective soil pH management.", "id": "97df7f58-5e2c-4dd8-91b3-6f7e61f9c7ec"}

This is way too low.  Cannabis should be between 6.8-6.9.  To raise the pH to 6.8-6.9: Add either 2 cups per yard of wollastonite or 1 cup per yard of aglime.  Recommending between aglime (agricultural lime) and wollastonite depends on the speed the grower wants to get to the target pH of 6.8-6.9.  Many growers would go with aglime to get to the target pH range of 6.8-6.9 quickly.  Because the pH will naturally go up because of other amendments being added, so Wollastonite can be recommended at 2 cups per yard.  However, at this drastic of a rise, 1 cup aglime might be the better recommendation given the severity of the drop.\n\nQUESTION:\nRecommending 2 cups per yard of Wollastonite or 1 cups per yard of Lime doesn't align with the 1.1 - 1.3.  Assuming 1.3, it should be a cup and 1/3?  But ultimately maybe it is good enough? I believe the main question is how did Brandon get to the 1 cup and then 2 cup.?\n\nAs a liming agent, Wollastonite's bond with Silicate is stronger than Lime's bond with CO3.  This means: 1. The pH rises more gradually with Wollastonite. 2. It takes more Wollastonite than Lime to get to the same change.  How much more depends on what I read.

High levels of nitrates, however, can lead to significant plant health issues, including excessive clawing (tip to petiole), abnormal darkening of plants, and impaired flowering. Contrary to common misconceptions, symptoms like necrosis or dead tissue in plants, often attributed to nitrogen burn, are usually indicative of trace element deficiencies, particularly in calcium.", "id": "efc17e8e-5a33-4753-9729-d9cf617eb21e"}

Nitrogen Fixation:** In this process, atmospheric nitrogen (N\u2082) is converted into ammonia (NH\u2083) or related nitrogenous compounds in soil. This can occur biologically, through the action of nitrogen-fixing bacteria (often associated with the roots of legumes and some other plants), or through non-biological means such as the Haber-Bosch process and natural phenomena like lightning.\n\n**2. Nitrification:** Once ammonia is introduced into the soil, nitrifying bacteria convert it first into nitrite (NO\u2082\u207b) and then into nitrate (NO\u2083\u207b). This process typically occurs in aerobic conditions. Nitrate is a form of nitrogen that is readily absorbed by plants.\n\n**3. Assimilation:** Plants absorb nitrates and ammonium from the soil and incorporate them into plant proteins and other organic compounds.\n\n**4. Ammonification (or Mineralization):** When plants, animals, and microorganisms die or excrete waste, the organic nitrogen within their bodies is converted back into ammonium by a diverse range of microorganisms. This process of ammonification occurs in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It's a key step in the nitrogen cycle, as it recycles the nitrogen found in organic matter back into a form that can be used by plants and other organisms.\n\n**5. Denitrification:** This process reduces nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N\u2082), completing the nitrogen cycle. Denitrification typically occurs in anaerobic conditions, where bacteria use nitrates instead of oxygen for respiration, releasing nitrogen gas back into the atmosphere.\n\nThis cycle is crucial for maintaining the balance of nitrogen in the ecosystem. Each step is facilitated by different types of microorganisms and environmental conditions, highlighting the complexity and interdependence of life and the environment in the nitrogen cycle.", "id": "22e5b5ec-f8e3-4fb8-90df-454daa46a0d6"}

Different meals, such as soybean meal and neem seed meal, are commonly used as organic nitrogen sources in soil amendments. These materials serve not only as nutrient sources but also play a role in pest management strategies.\n\n**Soybean Meal:** Soybean meal is a byproduct of soybean oil production. It is rich in nitrogen and is an excellent organic fertilizer, slowly releasing nitrogen into the soil. Soybean meal typically contains high levels of nitrogen, making it a potent source for plant growth. \n\n**Neem Seed Meal:** Neem seed meal is derived from the seeds of the neem tree after the oil has been extracted. It is known not only for its nitrogen content but also for its pest-repellent properties. \n\n**Concerns with Oil in Soil Amendments:** It's important to note that while neem oil, extracted from neem seeds, is a common organic pesticide, adding oils directly to the soil is generally not advisable in IPM. Oils in the soil can create imbalances, potentially harming beneficial microorganisms and affecting soil structure and aeration. Thus, when choosing amendments like neem or soybean products, it's preferable to use meals where the oil has been extracted, as they offer the nutritional benefits without the negative effects of excess oil in the soil.", "id": "95198c4d-4b13-4f2d-9152-2cf3fb6c772c"}

It provides a rapid boost of nitrogen, making it especially useful for correcting nitrogen deficiencies in the short term. \n- Fish Bone Meal: Benefits: Fish bone meal is a source of both nitrogen and phosphorus. It releases nitrogen slowly, providing a steady supply over a longer period. \n- Alfalfa Meal: Benefits: Alfalfa meal is a slower-releasing nitrogen source compared to blood meal. It also contains trace minerals and works as a soil conditioner, improving soil health over time. Alfalfa is known for its triacontanol content, a natural growth stimulant for plants.  Alfalfa meal is a rich source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, with an average N-P-K value of 3-1-2.  Alfalfa contains a natural growth hormone called Triacontanol that stimulates plant growth and development. This hormone aids in the development of lateral branches, resulting in larger, healthier plants with more bud sites. It also contributes to fruit size and flavor, leading to amazing results. Using alfalfa meal in your garden can help you achieve healthier, more robust crops.\n- Soybean Meal: Benefits: Soybean meal is another organic, slower-releasing nitrogen source. It is particularly effective in improving soil texture and fostering beneficial microbial activity in the soil. This gradual nitrogen release supports consistent plant growth.\n- Neem Seed Meal: Benefits: Neem seed meal is valued not only for its nitrogen content but also for its pest-repellent properties. It helps in managing various soil-borne pests and diseases, making it a dual-purpose amendment for nutrition and pest management.\n- Feather Meal: Benefits: Feather meal is a byproduct of poultry processing and is high in nitrogen. It releases nitrogen slowly, making it suitable for long-term nutrition plans. Feather meal is ideal for promoting lush, green growth in plants.\n- Oilseed Meals (General): Benefits: General oilseed meals (like cottonseed, sunflower seed, and canola meal) are good nitrogen sources. They often contain other nutrients and organic matter, contributing to overall soil fertility and structure.\n- Insect Frass: Benefits: Insect frass is a less common but valuable nitrogen source. It not only provides nitrogen but also contains chitin, which can help boost plant immune responses against certain pathogens and pests.", "id": "51121b5c-20de-4efc-8d6f-d656415ce6b8"}

Tad noted Phosphorous is a \"luxury\" nutrient.  Too much doesn't seem to hurt the plant.  However, there is a limited amount of Phosphorous left and an overabundance of Phosphate damages the environment.\n\nThe discussion covers Phosphorous's role in plant energy transfer, particularly in forming ATP, and its importance for root development and flowering. Specific methods for unlocking phosphorus in soil are mentioned, including adjusting soil pH, using phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, and applying organic matter. Also discussed are bone meal and rock phosphate as amendments. The importance of soil testing, specifically the Saturated Paste test, is highlighted to accurately gauge phosphorus levels and avoid over-application, ensuring effective utilization and minimizing soil health impact.  Phosphorus is in limited supply, underlining its critical role and the importance of efficient management.\n\nThe Phosphorous ppm value on the Saturated Paste test lets us know how much phosphorous is readily available to the plant.  Brandon notes while a goal might be 2.4%, very few obtain this goal.  Tad noted some growers have around 0.36% and have good grows.  In the book, Steve notes we don't really see deficiency indications (Purple/darkened leaves and stems) until there is extreme deficiency.  He also notes the more phosphorous availability the better.\n\nWays to increase available phosphorous includes:\n- using  phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, like those in products like Mammoth P.\n- Using fish hydrolysate, stabilized with Phosphoric acid makes Phosphorous immediately available.", "id": "feb2e1e5-db99-4a71-8caf-b64cab85f0e1"}

Each type of atom is usually given a specific color for clarity: carbon is black, hydrogen is white, nitrogen is blue, and oxygen is red. This color-coding helps people quickly identify and understand the molecule's structure.*\n\n- Magnesium is a component of chlorophyll.  Chlorophyll contains a magnesium ion surrounded by four Nitrogen ions and a long hydrocarbon tail.\n\n- Gross magnesium deficiencies are recognizable as whitish or very light green streaks on the leaves because the leaves have failed to form sufficient chlorophyll.  If you suspect a deficiency, an easy way to figure this out is to add a heaping tablespoon of Epsom salts in one gallon of water and spray the leaves.  If the next set of leaves are green, then you were right - magnesium was deficient.  Brandon notes:  Magnesium for me is the easiest to diagnose. It's just glaring when you have a magnesium deficiency. It's the interveinal chlorosis on the lowers and the most recently matured. So if you've got tiger striping anywhere but the top of your plant, you've got a magnesium deficiency.\n\n- **Sources of Magnesium**: The most economical source of magnesium is mentioned as dolomite lime, especially when calcium is also needed. Dolomite lime typically contains 27% calcium and 11.5% magnesium\u200b\u200b. A challenge with dolomite.  It is much harder than Calcium so it takes longer to break down.  Brandon notes:  For magnesium, we're going to do Epsom salt, magnesium sulfate. So we're bringing in magnesium and we're bringing in sulfur, just like the conversation with gypsum. You can stack that sulfur in the soil with no issue. And so you're really just thinking about the magnesium that you're bringing in. And that makes it really easy to hit your targets.\n    \n-  **Magnesium Oxide**: Magnesium oxide (MgO), considered by some as the best and cheapest source of magnesium, is not approved for organics but is available as an animal feed supplement and in health food stores\u200b\u200b.\n    \n- **Magnesium Saturation Guidelines**: The book advises not to consider magnesium excessive unless its saturation exceeds 12% and suggests not adding magnesium unless saturation is below 6%\u200b\u200b.\n    \n- **pH Adjustment and Magnesium**: Using dolomite for pH adjustment can be beneficial as it raises pH more effectively than high-calcium lime and provides magnesium as an essential plant nutrient.

Would you be willing to share about that sort of you're you want to hear my words? You want to hear my life story sort of. I yeah I mean I think that's one of the most interesting reasons for you know why you wrote the book and why it had such an impact. Yeah well listen you know first of all we're all very good at talking about ourselves. And yeah I'd be happy to tell you the story because it's you could say my life sort of set me up to get interested in the question of nutrition and food and health because I started out with rather poor health as a youngster and about the age of 30 I've been through if you'd known me in my 20s you never would have thought I wouldn't have mounted anything in life. I mean you know before I was 24 I was just a stone pothead. I gave up using hallucinogens in my early 20s because they really damaged me. We had a teacher at University I went to and he was a Cherokee witch doctor medicine man PhD in anthropology who mostly studied us white people and he spoke I don't know eight or nine languages and he said we shouldn't mess with peyote. He said if you do that it's going to hurt you. He said it's a ceremonial thing it should be used for religious purposes in a ceremonial manner you shouldn't just be using it to get stone and have a party. He says it'll damage you. In those days we could buy it. There was no problem just $10 this miscaptus ranch and Antonio Tepsis and they sent you a hundred buds by railway express for 10 cents a flower a plant. And they were wild harvested plants you know and and anyway that's sort of my life and I got out of that stuff and proceeded to get in a business and for some reason around the age of 30 I was inspired to subscribe to organic gardening and farming magazine. I was living in a cockroach apartment in an area of Los Angeles called the little Korea square mile of Asians predominantly Koreans. Lots of interesting restaurants, karate school and every other street corner. I actually trained Tequondo while I was there. And anyway, I'm reading organic gardening magazine and I came on an article with a little thing just an inch in the front of current happenings, news reports, John Jebons of ecology action of the midpinnsla as just published a 18 page mimeograph report on how to grow $8,000 with the food on 5,000 square feet. And I was in business and I thought this could be a business. So I sent him $4.95 and he sent me his report and I read his report and it inspired me and we started looking for some property and we had a little business operating out of our dining room in the little Korea doing graphic arts and type setting that was called in those days. There's no such business anymore. It's all done on personal computers these days. Anyway, we bought a 1 acre property, way out on a fringes of Los Angeles and put in a huge food garden and I started to do what I thought John Jebons said to do. And I had a half an acre under cultivation and raised beds for feet wide, you know, 25 feet long, hundred square feet per bed, sprinklers, blah, blah, blah, blah, and I started, I got a pickup truck and I started taking rates of food down to the central protest markets and none of them would buy anything that I took them. And after three or four times down there, some protest merchant took pity on this poor young man, and said, hey, kid, I'm going to try and explain to you why it is I won't buy your food. Come on with me and he took me into his cooler and there a set on the floor was a stack of flats, low crates, you know, they're only about about this deep and they're full of beetroot and I had beetroot. These beetroot were perfect. Every one of them was exactly the same size as every other one. Every other one was everyone was perfectly round with a hair-like caproot and beautiful leaves and a small crown and a little flat spot on either side where they had bumped the beetroot in the next row. And the moment that the beetroot's bumped, the farmer harvested them, there wasn't a trace of any kind of insect they were just crisp and alive and vibrant with energy and perfect. And then I went back and look at what I had in my truck and I realized why he wouldn't buy this stuff, you know. And you know, the scars and scabs and multiple tap roots and not round and a lot kinds of differences and a lot of poor plants. So I knew how to sell at this point and I got on the phone and within an hour I was talking to John Gibbons and I said, John, I said, I've been doing your method and I'm failing. And nobody will buy when I'm growing. I've liked to buy you a round trip ticket to Los Angeles and put you up in a hotel and pay you $200 which is a lot of money in 1974 and all I want you to do is tell me what I'm doing wrong. And he said, no, I said, no, he said, no, he said, no, he said, I don't want to help you. I said, why don't you want to help me? He says, because you're trying to make money. He said, I invented this whole thing for the people, not for you to have a business, whatever, some hippie thing, you know, the people. Now I suppose if you plan at 144 carrots on a square foot using John Gibbons's method, two or three of them would be marketable. The rest of them would be edible if you were willing to go to the trouble of scrubbing them clean and all that sort of stuff, but they weren't marketable. So anyway, I gave up on that and just went on and grew my veggie garden and got to be very good at growing vegetables. And eventually sold the business, sold the house and we retire and moved to a five-acre block and rural, or I'm going to and I homestead it. And I started looking for a way to make a living off my own property, which is everybody's dream if you can do that. And I looked at various things including growing fruit tree seedlings, for example, in a little map of varieties and that's sort of thing. Anyway, I ended up in the seed business. And I was organic, of course. I believe all that's though. I read every publication that organic, arting magazine, a rodeo, press put out. I don't know if you're familiar with the ethos of the 1970s, but there was a lot of, you know, hostility towards chemical agriculture and standard economy. And I thought it was right. I didn't know any better. So I went in the seed business, made a big trial around. It was a half an acre. And I did it organically. There was a big horse stable in Cottage, Groove, Oregon, 15 miles away and I bought a pickup truck. And every time I went shopping and Cottage Groove, I came home with a groaning pickup truck full of horse poop. Oh, it wasn't horse poop. It was mostly Douglas for a sawdust with a little bit of horse mid-art. And if you bits of urine in it, and it wouldn't even heat up if you got it wet. But I thought it was compost. And I brought it home, and I spread it out interesting. And I rode already cultivated it in, and I put out a whole lot of cotton seed meal and some lime. And because I added a lot of nitrogen things grew anyway, despite the fact that there were digesting a whole lot of sawdust in the soil. And I produced food. And I did variety trials. And I didn't know how to run the seed business. And I didn't have any money. And I was having a very hard time. The first year in the seed business, I didn't make anything. Well, I did. I earned 4,000 names of mailing lists, which are worth a great deal. And I had a line of credit now with the seed players of seed. But still, that business required quite a bit of cash in the bank to make it happen. As you had to buy all these catalogs and print all these catalogs and fill up all these seed packets and so forth. So it took quite a few years before I could bootstrap this business to a point that it could actually support me. So I had a lady friend at that time. Actually, she was my doctor. Her name was Isabelle Moser, and she ran the great old school of health. And she had, even just before I\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:10:02\n```\n fast. And she began to educate me. So I mentioned her that I was having a hard time coming up with money. And she said, well, less no problem. She says, you got to have an acre of vegetables. Just eat them. It's just to eat them all. I mean, just 85% vegetables. She says, it'll be good for you. You'll get healthier. So I did. I didn't have any choice. It's the only reason I managed to stay in business was that I, you know, I could live on next to nothing. That year, I think I lived on $4,000. The next year, I made $7,000. But I lived on $4,000, because if I could do it once, I could do it again. And I put the other 3,000 back into the business. So then the next year, I made $14,000. And the year after that, we made about $30,000. Now I had a going business. But for those first three years, you know, I wouldn't have made it if I hadn't been a vegetableitarian. So about three years into the business, I think it should be about 1984. We weren't feeling good. Oh, an Isabelle had come over to visit me one day in 1982. Not done my door in the middle of the summer. And let me know about her feelings and ended up in the summer. So now, I didn't even know she felt that way. All those years, she very well kept it away from me. It was very professional. Anyhow. So, I wasn't a ball and I are living there. And we're eating my trials model. And she's just delighted to be eating all these vegetables. They were better at food supply than she'd ever had. And from her point of view, so we ate most of my vegetables about two years in that, and we started to have health problems. Isabelle's fingernails started to break. And her hair started to get brittle. And I was losing energy. And on my teeth, we're actually getting loose in my jaw. My body was de-mineralizing. And the business seemed very stressful. Life seemed very stressful. And I had a little money now. We seemed like we needed to have a rest. So, I organized and not do trials that summer. And Isabelle and I and her daughter, Sael, who was 13, got on an airplane and went to Fiji. And we stayed in Suba Fiji for six months. And we went shopping in the produce market. And we went swimming in the Olympic length of outdoors swimming pool in Suba. And we rode the bus. And handed the driver our cassette tape of Bob Marley when we got on the bus. And we listened to Bob Marley with everybody on the bus. And other people did that sort of thing too in Fiji. And the bus player drivers always had their own music system in their bus. And anyway, we had a great time there. Squeak the mattress a great deal. Got lots of rest. Our health got enormously better. My Keith got taken with my jaw. Isabelle's hair got shiny. Her fingernails got high. Our energy level got so good. That Isabelle took a chance. And we're registered for the Fiji marathon, even though she'd never run a marathon before. And she completed it and did fairly well for a woman in her four leg forties. And so anyway, it was really good. Why were we feeling so much better? So I went out of the produce market. And I started to ask the commission merchants down there, were they at their vegetables? And I expected they tell me they came from this little village here and this little person over there and it wasn't that case at all. Actually there were some rather big for Fiji vegetable producers. And they were all located in one area called the Singatoka Valley, which was a little over and I was derived from Suba. And so I rang up the government research station in Singatoka and introduced myself as somebody in the seed business and they invited me to come over. And we rented a car. We went to the Singatoka Valley. And as I was driving up the valley to the research station, I fell into lust. I had never before lusted for a piece of soil. Oh, I was trying to figure out how could I buy some of that. How could I live there? It was so beautiful, black, crumbly, lone soil. I went to the experiment station. And I said, how do you all grow vegetables here? He says, well, he says, we have two seasons. He says, there's a dry season when it isn't too hot in humid. And then there's the rainy season. And during the rainy season we can't grow anything. So the vegetable, the weeds grow chest high in the rainy season. They take over everything when the rains start. And in the dry season starts, we plow the weeds in. That's our green manure. And then we grow vegetables. And then at the end of the zombie and all the dry season, it's starting to get real hot and humid in the weeds take over. And the vegetables all die of disease. And they grow chest high. And we've been doing that for 75 years. And nobody has ever brought a bag of fertilizer into this valley. Oh, of course, we spray a lot. I mean, you know, there's no end of pests that want to eat temperate season vegetables in the tropics. It's not easy to grow them under any conditions. But so here I was eating, unfertilized, no compost, no manure, no animals, no fertilizer. And these food, totally outside the definition of what you do is an organic gardener. And this food is making this healthy. And it's got pesticide residues in it. That was really, you know, it upset my, my worldview. So I went back to Suba and found the British government agricultural geological surveys of the island and discovered that the singletoka river rose on a watershed that was almost entirely ultra basic agonious rock. And that's something you would have no experience with Ted because they're in any around you. It's a rather rare thing. You have basic agonious rock. The basaltes that make up the cascade range. I don't know what about the Olympic range. I think they're different stuff. I'm not sure. But certainly, I'm almost all the soils in Oregon and Washington all derived out of this basalt. And this basalt is a basic agonious rock. It makes soils that are only slightly acidic and have a reasonable degree of mineralization. The ultra basic rock is so mineralized that the soils that it makes are actually neutral to slightly alkaline and they're hugely mineralized. So, you know, basic agonious rocks are very black and very dense. And they have a much higher specific gravity than most thickness rocks. And they're not a lot of them. Anyway, I realized something very important that I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know why. Why am I so much healthier? So, somebody told me a wonderful line the other day. A question that can't be answered is far more valuable than an answer that can't be questioned. Yeah, our world has been given a lot of answers these days that we can't question, you see. And they reinforced them all the time. I don't know how many I don't have much American television for God knows how many decades. But when I first came to Australia in 1998, I spent a year or so looking at the ABC at the time and just to pick up the local culture. And, you know, there's never a six months go by before they don't give us television program about the big bang or about the descent of man from the ape. Or any of the other bullshit narratives that they push on us all the time. And, you know, so everybody believes you can't get well if you don't go to the doctor. Everybody believes you have to have an oculation. Everybody believes the vaccine stopped all the childhood diseases. All of that's not true. Anyway, they keep, you know, reinforcing our belief systems. So, I had this question. What is it that made that food so nutritious? It made us so much healthier. And I started doing research. And there was somebody that I'd never paid too much attention to, although I heard about him and his name was William Albrecht. And I started reading Albrecht. And Albrecht's not easy to read. Sometimes his writing was often very concentrated. Every word has a lot of import. You have to really consider every sentence before you go into the next. And most of his writing. Anyway, I began to comprehend Albrecht and saw that there were relationships in soils that seem to produce better nutrition. And I created a fertilizer that I started to use in my garden books called Computer Getting Fertilizer. And the first iterations of that fertilizer were very stupid. And, you know, I didn't know anything about trace elements. I assumed they weren't a problem. I knew that I wanted a certain kind of ratio of calcium in the magnesium in the soil. So I put that ratio into my fertilizer. You know, using Dolomite Lyme and Agline to come up to about us seven calciums to one magnesium. And so forth. And it worked. I mean, it was a lot better than, you know, what most people were doing at that time. And since most of the poor result in food gardening, and I saw anyway in my area, was caused by lack of nitrogen. And so the cotton seed meal that I was using in those days in Oregon took care of that. And so in spite of the fact that gardeners were putting all kinds of undigested carbon\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:20:08\n```\n place where it never gets the soil doesn't even warm up properly, you know, until July, why they weren't getting any growth in May and June, you know, and things were so slow. And then when they don't grow very well in the early part of the year, they don't get very big at the end of the year. And anyway, things work much better when there's, you know, adequate levels of nitrogen from the time you put the seeds in the ground. And that that can all the seed meal to a care of it. And then we put in some phosphorus because the soils in cascadier are all a phosphorus deficient. And then some. And very few places in cascadier needed any potassium. So that was no problem. I didn't put any in. And that was it, you know, and I think there was some kelp and and with lagalime and, you know, a little dolomite. Anyway, that's what I used. And we, we sold the farm that we had the seed business on. And when I sold the seed business, and I Isabella and I moved to 16 acres of the best soil in Oregon in the best microclimate in Oregon. That's according to Colonel Rex Applegate, who surveyed the Oregon territory in the 1850s. And this is where he settled. Also, it was in the same area. It's the uncoil river between Elkton and Scottsburg. That's it. That 15 miles stretch along the river. You're far enough in land that you don't get 80 inches of rain, but you're not so far in land that you don't get enough rain. And it doesn't get quite so hot in the summer. So the temperatures are good, but it's close enough for the ocean that it doesn't get as frosty in the wintertime. I mean, it's just about the best and they have beautiful, uh, silky clay-loam soils, but the Eluvian soils along the river, they're, I mean, it's best as it can be in that state. Uh, so there we were. And when we started eating off of that soil, uh, using my COF, uh, things got a lot better. And our health improved, uh, it was also that the first place we had in, in the Lorraine Oregon was just crap soil. It wasn't even soil. I wasn't smart enough to realize it when I bought the place, but there was no top soil. We bought an e-spacing hillside that had no top soil. And I know it had no top soil because the next three-acre piece over, uh, at the, uh, Chris step across the fence line and you stepped up, uh, almost 12 inches. Right on the fence line, 12 inches, just like a step up. And what it happened was for, I don't know, 50 years, 60 years, 70 years, some farmer grow on winter wheat on that property on that slope, and had had so much, uh, you know, surface erosion that all the top soil was gone. And when it got to be too bad, why they stopped growing grain there, and they started growing grass and cut the hay. And then when the hay wasn't sufficient to pay for the cost of cutting and bailing, they'd divided it up in the five-acre parcels, then sold it to fools from the city like me. You know, we're making lifestyle changes, uh, and I wasn't smart enough to realize how degraded this piece of property was. And so in that infernal sub-soil, silty, uh, clay sub-soil on that property, with enough fertilizer to grow some food, but it was so out of balance that it wasn't very good food. The soil in Elton Oregon was a lot better. So anyway, um, the unfortunate thing about living in Elton was it was 75 miles from Eugene. It was 55, 50 miles to the nearest supermarket, and for social life at that time where my conscious was at that time, I had two choices. I could either go to the pub and drink but was your beer and talk about hunting and fishing. Or I could go to the evangelical church, there were two of them in Elton, and when Winston and I Bible study. And at that time, I was not a Christian. I'm a Jew, by the way. And I have some spiritual interest, but I wasn't interested in Christianity. And I'm certainly not into drinking but was there beer and talking about hunting and fishing. And unfortunately, there was no internet. So we saw the place, and Isabelle being a Canadian, and maybe being her husband, they couldn't stop me from being a landed immigrant, and I feel that the paper worked and we moved the Canada. Thinking, well, we'll have a bit of an adventure. We'll be in another country. We'll have new opportunities and maybe we'll be led to one thing or another. So we moved to Nelson, British Columbia, and started hanging out, and set up a new life, and it was very stressful for Isabelle. And I never should have done it. But anyway, that's what happened. And a year later, Isabelle came down with cancer. And she'd had cancer twice before. She had it at age 26, she had it at age 37. Each time she made it go away. By changing her life the first time, she had a bad relationship. The second time, she did a long water fast and a lot of detail application, and managed to shrink up this breast tumor made it go away. But this time her body was a bit tired, or she was older. There was no getting away from the stress, because we weren't living quietly in the country anymore. I suppose we could have re-established that, but anyway, it was too late in Isabelle got sick. And after a year of fighting it, she passed away. And a year later, I found myself in Tasmania, living in a house in the bush, with a big veggie garden, and learning how to garden here. And I wrote a book. I'll show you. I'm almost no one in America has seen this book. Excuse me, don't go away. I'm just going to have your feet. There you go. Probably backwards. Right, we arranged. Now we can call the vegetables, south of Australia. And I've been criticized for the title of this book, because I'm promoting sedition and succession. South of Australia, we're another country down here, and we really should be. Tasmania is a different country than mainland Australia. But anyhow, I wrote that book, and I started giving garden talks, and I started trying to teach people, because Tasmania had exactly the same problems in 1999 that Oregon had in 1973 or four when I moved there. To the same problem, we were the tail of a big dog, the mainland. The big dog, you guys, you're the tail of the rest of the country. The rest of the country doesn't care about you, really. You know, the publishing industry is in New York. The garden books, especially in those days, were all about Eastern United States. All the seed companies were in the Eastern United States. The varieties we were being offered were for the Eastern United States. It was the same here. The seeds all came from the mainland. They didn't even have any lettuce varieties that could survive the winter and Tasmania when I first came here. For example, it's my older here than it is where you live. It's my older here that it's like the best places in Southern Oregon. You could imagine Tasmania. It's just lovely. But I couldn't find a lettuce variety that would survive the winter. I fixed that. Anyway, so I wrote this book for the same kind of reason to educate my neighbors about how to take, oh, also my neighbors, a lot of them didn't know about winter gardening. They thought it was too cold here to go to the garden in the winter. So anyway, I'm trying to educate them. One day, I've been the moderator of online conversation group, the old email chat groups. They're not much anymore. Anyway, it's called soil and health. The gosh, there were a thousand people that are more than that group at that time. I made a post. I said, I don't know what's going on. I've been growing my garden here now at this location here in Tassey for the last three years. I've been using my complete organic fertilizer. The soil is getting harder. I've been doing a lot of compost in, but the soil is getting harder and harder and more and more difficult to work. And there's a fellow who'd been lurking on the list that made a post and his name was Michael of Stero. Some of you may be familiar with Michael of Stero. He said, Steve, he said, I know exactly what's wrong. He said, because I know you're using this recipe. You've got this fertilizer mix and I know what is in it. He says, and you've got no limit lying in there and you almost certainly got soil. This got too much magnesium in it and the more of that dolomite you put in there, the more airless and sticky your soil gets. He said, why don't you just stop using dolomite and replace it with the same weight of aglime that you just change your recipe in that respect. Take out the dolomite. No, I did that. And the next year, everything was much better. And Michael said, yeah, you were just barely over the line of too much magnesium. Now you pulled back from it and things are back and better balanced. Have you read my book? I said, no. And so Michael sent me a copy of the ideal soil. And I read the book.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:30:19\n```\n form to figure out what your soil, you know, recipe should be. Michael, how many books do you sell every year? Oh, 200. I said, Michael, this is so important. You should sell 20,000 books every year. We should change the world. Not just 200. I said, why don't we publish something that we could, we could, you know, I'll co-author on with you. I got context in the publishing world, if I say I'm writing a book, there'll be a couple of publishers that just jump up and want to publish it. Let's do it. So we made an agreement. And we started writing a co-author in the book. Michael was going to do all the soil analysis bits. And I was going to write sort of the history of the organic gardening and farming movement explaining why organic is not the approach that we want to use exactly. And also, I could write some pretty good information about making compost about which Michael had no practical experience, because although he was a soil advisor, never grown anything in his life, as far as I know. So anyway, we said fourth. I got a contract with Pacific Search Press, up on Grabrior, Ireland, and we had a deadline. When you publish garden-related books, by the way, they have to come out in time to get on the spring book list in the book shops, because that's when you sell all the garden books. So, and then if you work back from that time and how long it takes to print, and then how long it takes to edit, and how all the prep, you got to have a manuscript in hand by August to have a book that comes out by December. You see, that's just normal. So we had a deadline. We had about a year to work on the book. And about six months into it, I had a rough draft. And I wrote Michael and I said, how are you doing? And he says, I haven't done anything. I said, Michael, I said, we made an appointment. We got an agreement with the publisher. They're expecting a book. We're not going to deliver on time this way. I said, so Michael, we have to make a choice. Either you're going to write this book without me, or I'm going to write this book without you. And if I write it, it's going to be done on time. If you write it, I don't care when you get it done. It's your reputation. I'm out of it. So Michael said, I don't want to do it. So I was faced with the problem of learning how to be a soil analyst with about a six-month deadline to deliver a manuscript. And I made that known on soil and health. And I discovered that there were half a dozen soil analysts have been looking on that forum all these years and never announced themselves as such. So they started giving the advice. And I started getting all kinds of soil tests from Logan Labs from various people on the forum and then running Michael's system on them and publishing the prescription. And some of them made sense and some of those prescriptions were pretty wild with huge amounts of amendments being put in into heavier soils. And we wrestled with that and the first thing that was suggested was, you need to have application limits. It's like there's a maximum amount of anything you ever put into the soil at one time. That will save you from making a lot of serious mistakes. And so I got that concept really good. And we worked out reasonable application limits that were suggested by other soil analysts. And then we finally realized what was wrong with Michael's system. It was linear. And if you had a soil, I hope everybody here knows a bit about soil analysis, because I'm just going to have to say it in soil analysis language. If you got a soil with an exchange capacity around 12, then everything in my system was perfect. The numbers that would generate were perfect for a soil with a CEC of about 12. But I think got heavier than that. The amounts of that were being put in just went up literally with the CEC. And so you could end up putting enormous amounts of some nutrients in there. What actually, it was not necessary. In fact, maybe harmful. And on the other hand, if the soil got light, you maybe didn't put in enough. And so we needed to figure out some way to adjust that. And eventually, Erika and I figured it out. And what we did was, is it actually made a spreadsheet. And we worked out the amount that would be put in at Erika's point and increase the exchange capacity. And we looked at it all and I realized when I was looking at that sheet, we don't even need to do all this arithmetic. I could just put that spreadsheet in there and say, find your exchange capacity. There's your targets. All on one page. And it would have eliminated all the arithmetic. But the book was already 90% written. So we just left that as it was and put it out there. I'm telling you all this stuff so that you won't have any overblown opinion about about my experience. You know, I'm really just a gardener. And it's only after I publish that book that I actually started to look at a whole lot of soil tests and become a neighborhood soil analyst like I asked people to do in the book. And I've done a lot of that here in Tassie. So I've learned a great deal since since I published the book. And I can tell you that I no longer use the method exactly that's in the book. It's just long and tedious and also my experience tells me that I probably should make some adjustments to what I'm, you know, the targeting that this book is recommending, not thing serious. But I haven't bothered to redo the book. And you know, I just do what I do. So that's kind of how I got here. The other thing I can tell you about this, go back to the original conversation about nutrition. You're all this seeing my head and neck and picking up my attitude. Okay. And how I feel, I guess, in general. But I just want to remind you, I'm 81 years old. And I can still do a hard morning's work. I can still bend over and touch my T toes. I can squat and get up dozens and dozens of times, but no problem. I can get down on my knees. I can push wheel barrels. I can dig beds. But at 81, after three or four hours of it, I'm done for the day. Yeah, I don't have the endurance anymore and not quite as much physical strength. But I'm doing pretty good. And at the current rate of deterioration on thinking, I might all last my parents who lived to be 90, they didn't even take care of themselves. They smoke cigarettes until they had infosema and there are some of these. They ate all kinds of junk food. You know, they had no idea about nutrition whatsoever. So yeah, now Steve, can I ask you a few questions here and then open it up to other people that I'm sure will have questions? Oh, we have one other thing. You might want to talk about cannabis. Yes, we will want to talk about cannabis. All right, we'll do that too. Great. Great. Yes. So the first question I had was, and just a clarification. So this book is, and your targets are really designed around nutrient density for growing healthy vegetables. That's right. Great. And so that, so these targets are not necessarily about maximizing your yield. You're not opposed to sulfates using low levels of chemical fertilizers when they make sense. I just want to I just want to throw everything out there that I've either said before and make sure that I'm not miss speaking for you and I talk about, you know, some of your beliefs in the book itself. And these targets are also designed for actual soil, not potting soil. That's right. Which very much I think is it would be an interesting conversation to have because I know you and I have talked throughout the years on your forums and privately and elsewhere about cannabis and about potting soil and how those things are very different than, you know, in terms of targets and how we interpret these tests, then they would be for vegetables. And this is something that we've been talking about as we've been going through your book. So I would love to hear your thoughts because everyone in here is a cannabis grower. And once I figured that was soil testing, yeah, but but still once they use soil testing as a way of better targeting fertility for their cannabis plant in potting soil. So given that back and reusing the potting soil cycle after cycle. So yeah, the living soil method, I understand. Okay, yes. I think I think that approach, by the way, is an extremely good approach. So you want me to start out, I'll make some comments about the difference between growing containers, basically, and growing outdoors. Just not so much. Yeah, it's not so much indoors outdoors. It's containers versus not containers. I think that's the really big difference.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:40:28\n```\n time of flowering, you can maintain environmental conditions and make it difficult for mold, you know, other those kind of diseases from getting and getting on your plants. So you can then grow them to fuller maturity. Whereas outdoors, you might be forced to harvest before you might want to. So there is that. But the biggest difference I see is if you take cognizance of how plants feed and we're learning more about that, all this stuff is coming out now about microfagious, so interesting. You know, we didn't know any of this stuff 20 years ago, although if you read, if you read Krasilnikov, soil microorganisms and higher plants, which is available for free download on the soil and health library, you'll see that he didn't have the technology to be able to identify species of microbes, for example, or species of fungi in the soil. I mean, of course, there's no way, especially at that time, to actually observe what was going on around the root in the soil because it was in the dark. And then you just had ordinary microscopes in those days and they weren't as good as they are today. But despite that, he managed to comprehend what was going on and observe a whole lot of the things that the microbes were doing. Even if his explanation was not completely, you know, correct. It still was very workable. Anyway, when plants feed, and listen, if this is in any way wrong, I don't know anybody better than you, Ted, to tell me that I'm a bit off-basier because I'm not, I'm not as, I don't have any economic justification to keep completely up with all the latest data. Right. When I get some of the networks, I've been content with it. I say, okay, I know something at works. I don't have to spend any more energy in this area, but I'll look at some Nelson's life. In any case, this is how I see it. Most of the feeding of plants is one of two ways. Either they can feed off of what's in the water solution in around their root. And so, anything that's dissolved in the soil solution they will intake, I think they have ability to do that somewhat selectively. I know that from what I hear from people who do hydro, they have to change the water in the reservoir, for example, if they're using a recirculating system, because after the plants have been using that solution for a while, they're withdrawals are not uniform and it starts getting badly out of balance, so they have to dump it and replace it with something that's in balance again. So, I assume the plants can make somewhat selective withdrawals from what's in the soil solution. The other way they get nutrients is from the root tips. Most of the feeding that most plants do is done by the root hairs and the root tips. There's just a few millimeters long piece at the very end of the root. And as the root expands, after it's grown a few millimeters, it starts both shedding, slowing off of the root hairs and developing the sort of a skin or a bark. And once that bark is present around the root, the root is no longer able to assimilate nutrition nearly as well. And a lot of this, I do read a rations with fungi and microbiome, rhizophage, and body, blah, blah, blah, blah. But the bottom line of it is, if the root can't expand, the plant can't feed. The minute that root expansion is greatly reduced, the plant's ability to obtain nutrition is greatly reduced. And to maintain a plant, the can't expand as root system very well, you have to use soluble fertilizers in the water or being added things that go into the solution in the soil. So you can get a container and put a plant and have the growing medium be very fertile and very balanced and really loaded up with plant nutrients as much as you can without raising the pH to eye. And the plant will make withdrawals from that until such time as its roots have ramified the whole container and it's pretty well rooted at which point the plant starts to suffer even though there's, you're in a soil test on what it's growing and it might tell you everything is fine. Well, the plant can't get it. So outdoors, the plant has a much greater ability to keep on extending its root system. So our year use of these beds is permanent beds that are, you know, 4 feet by 4 feet or 4 feet by 8 feet and 16, 18 inches deep. This bed provides the plant with enormously more soil volume than if it was in a small container. And so for that reason alone, I think it's just terrific. So I do that. In my own grow room, I use the biggest container, the biggest pot that I can barely pick up and rattle in a position. You know, I feel that was soil and that helps a lot. And when I see growers using smaller containers than that, toward the end, those are the ones who suffer from mold, from spider mites, from all those other problems. See, when the plant's really feeding adequately and has a very healthy root system in a very healthy root zone, this plant isn't going to have any problems. You agree with that, I see, so there's not in your head. I mean, yes, and I think that provided enough pest pressure, you will still get spider mites, even with a very healthy plant. I'm not convinced that plants have that ability just because my antimology friends Suzanne is very adamant to me that the research just doesn't support that. But I do agree that plants that are less stressed, that are healthier, are much more resistance to pests. And so like, especially you would see this outdoors. If you, if your farm is healthy and your neighbors is not in their feeding mineral salts and there's not the biology and the soil that protect the plant, I would assume that that crop would be much less healthy and be much more susceptible than your balanced, healthy, organic crop. I want to give you a little, I want to give you a little data to support that even further and you'll like this one. On Tasmania, there are two licensed growers of medical cannabis. And I'm working with one and the other one is down in your Hobart. And we talk to each other, you know, and they grow with chemicals. They, you know, grow broad acre agriculture, raising medicinal cannabis, both of CBD and CHC. We don't have a THC license. So we're, again, we've been waiting for them to approve our THC license for the last six months. And they keep telling us pretty soon, pretty soon, pretty soon. Anyway, it hasn't happened yet. But they had a big CBD crop in last year. They were growing Charlotte's angel. They lost over 75% of their flower to mold. We lost one tenth of one percent of our flower to mold last year. Both outdoor crops? Both outdoor crops. So my first thought would be genetics, the setability and the mynetic thought would be exactly what you're talking about here in terms of crop health. That's correct. And if I told you how much money, my farm spent trying to rehabilitate a piece of soil, which had basically been flawed to death for the last 20 years by a farmer. And you know, I mean, it was horrible. We put out on the hectare. We put out 300 cubic meters of compost. I can't do the metric math on that, but I'll assume it's a lot. 10,000 square meters, 300 cubic meters. Anyway. Okay. It's a more than an inch thick. Wow. Okay. Right. And yeah. And we put out, you know, traces. We put out all the organic soil release kind of fertilizers that we could. We didn't step anything. We put out a lot of account mail. Yeah. We did. And we had very healthy plants. Much better this year than last year. The first year was mostly just rehabilitating that soil. Yeah. We managed to grow a little bit anyway in the meantime. We're getting double the growth rates this year. We had last year. And the season is poor also. The weather hasn't been really good this year. So yeah. Anyway, so that kind of supports my viewpoint. Right there. I had trouble with spider-mites in my indoor growing. When I first started growing indoor, you know, I didn't know much about it.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:50:39\n```\n the cannabis growing advisor down there told me, well, if I was going to use the soil-based medium, what I want to use is canotero. So I bought canotero Vega and canotero florists and, you know, what they are. Anybody here listening? Not know what's in them? I mean, I don't have to talk. I'll see him nitrate, same stuff that you would see in my age. No, I don't think I'll see electricity. No, that was psycho. There's a fertilizer line called Psycho. Let's see why CO. Okay, and they use nitrates. And I've used Psycho. The guy who ran the hydro shop that I got my fertilizer from and gave me the advice to use canotero, he had been an indoor grower and he had used a psychosystem in Cocoa. And after we got to know each other for a few years, he said, hey, what you do in experiment for me, he said, I'll give you what's left in all my Psycho bottles and give you a program and you grow some of the plants in your grow room with Psycho and some of them would what you've been doing. And we'll make a contrast. So I did. The Psycho plant, one of the four plants, just completely fell apart with mold toward the end. Otherwise, they grew okay. They looked good. They didn't grow any better than mine. They didn't look any better, but mine didn't have any problems. And Psycho uses calcium nitrate and then they have to use magnesium nitrate, potassium nitrate, and then all their trace elements have to be some kind of advanced keylates so that they don't precipitate the calcium and and, you know, and it's kind of expensive, and you're paying a lot of money for a lot of water mostly. In it works. And Canada was all sulfates. And yeah, and there was no calcium in the Canada. So the reason that I had reasonable results with a cano system was as I had lime and gypsum in my growing medium. Oh, okay. But yeah, so it seemed to work. But I had spider mic problems. And I learned a lot about spraying spider mites and managed to produce anyway. But once I got off of that and started using different chemicals and using bigger pots, I haven't had a seen a spider mic in my room ever since. And I brought plants in. I brought hemp plants, cuttings from outdoor growing, and should have had spider mites on them. You know, and I brought them indoors. I brought them indoors and no spider mites. It's just they cannot thrive on these plants. In the vegetable garden, we have problems with what we call here in Tazzy cabbage grows. You know, the larvae of three different species of moth that like the cabbage plants, the vegetable that he believes. I started spraying, if you heard what John Pimp talks about, the plant health pyramid, I started going to bring it with John Pimp. And if you're not, you should be. I've heard some of this stuff, but I haven't kept up today with everything that he's been saying. What was the stuff Susan talked about for Spider mites? I don't know. Somebody is posted there. Oh, yeah, if there are some questions popping up over here on the side, kind of in order. I don't know if you want to read them or I could they could read it. Why don't you do me a favor and you keep track of them and then you just feed them to me when you think it's appropriate. I can focus on what I want to talk about. As I'm not skillful, I don't have the skills yet to do this kind of thing. I don't, this is only like about the second time I've ever done a Zoom conference. So anyway, the John Pimp talks about something called the plant health pyramid. And as the plant's nutrition gets better, it starts making more sugar. And it's excretes that sugar a lot of it out of its root zone and it feeds the microbiome living in its root zone, which then turns around and feeds the plant better. So the plant's investing sugar in its future food supply. As the plant gets even healthier and starts making even more sugar and even more sugar. It's not because the plant's larger, it's photosynthetic efficiency has increased. And eventually it has such a big supply of sugar that then it can make lipids. And as it starts excreting lipids out of its root zone, which are not digestible by bacteria, which are eaten by fungi. And John hemp says that these lipids are then converted directly into hummus. And that he's raised the organic matter content of fields growing row crops by one percent and one year this way. That's an amazing assertion. So anyway, what happens is that the leaves get coated with lipids and then they become glossy and they become virtually immune to anything that wants to eat them. So anyway, I grow these cabbage family plants in my garden. We've got a lot of cabbage groups. Every time it rains or every time I have to irrigate, I have heavy soil and I don't have to irrigate more than every ten days or so, usually. Anyway, every time that happens, I spray dipel and I mix into the spray tank, Nutrotech triple ten and about seven mills to the leader, which is comfortable with the plants. It's less than full strength, but it's just two thirds of the recommended dose. And what happens is that by about the third spray, I don't see any more cabbage groups. The first two sprays, I do. Diplos not perfect. You know, you still get a little damage. But anyway, after the about the third spray, there's no more damage. And after one year, a couple of years ago, I saw that happening and I just stopped spraying dipel. And you know what? I just sprayed the triple ten and there was no more damage. And the leaves had this glossy sheen to them. And if you looked on the underside of the leaves, you will see the eggs of these moss and the eggs hatch. And then the little grubs start traveling across the leaf and they cannot eat. They cannot chew through the glossy layer of lipids on the outside of the plant. They started death before they're big enough to even be seen. So what plants not going to develop that kind of health and that kind of feeding efficiency, if it's confined in a little container. And as we've been learning lately, you cannot replace with soluble what happens through microfaggie and through, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the, the microvisual relationships and other, I don't think we probably even know the smallest part of what's really going on in the biology and those in that system. You know, there's a lot more we don't know than we do know. Oh, yeah. So, yeah, I think we talk about that. The idea that with organic gardening, what makes the vegetables, so taste so much better, or with cannabis, what makes the products so much, the final part so much better is the fact that there is this biology that's creating all these interactions that we don't fully understand that not only help protect the plants, but also will help with, you know, creating unique cannabinoids and terpines and those sorts of things. Yeah. Yeah. And so you asked me earlier, you know, what kind of, you know, so like, I'm advisory vegetables, you know, what would I advise doing with cannabis and I would say with cannabis, if you, if you want a really rich result, if you want a plant that's just loaded with resin and terpines and that's healthy, you want to fertilize it like it's the most demanding vegetable crop you could ever want to grow. And if you don't, now you're going to feel crop and now you're like that farmer, but he's in cannabis now in Southern Tasmania who's having a lot of mold problems. Yeah. So luxury levels of a lot of these minerals. That's right. That's right. And you could say a luxury level of organic matter. Oh, but not nearest high as what most people want to target. I mean, that's a conversation too, you know, as how much organic matter do you really need? And we don't need as much as what most, most organically inclined gardeners or growers want to put it in the soil. I think there's a very important distinction that needs to be made between using organic matter to feed the, the biology in the soil and using organic matter to supply the nutrients that the plants need. And I don't think you should do this second thing. I don't think we should try to nourish plants with organic matter in a general roof in nourish plants with fertilizer. It's concentrated forms of plant nutrients, whether they meet the definition of organic or not as the ravise want to give it out. I look upon organic certification bureaucrats like their Jewish ravenet, you see, and they have all these ridiculous rules.\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:00:49\n```\n in Israel, and by the way, not at all, please, with Israel at the moment. But anyway, the, I spent two months working on an Israeli military base in 1987. Just a few months before the first into Fata started. And naturally with my karma, the base that they sent me to fed the entire Israeli army. It was just a huge warehousing and food distribution operation. Israel's not a very big country, you know. It's not as big as the island of Tasmania. So every day, every couple days, the base would send a truck down there and they'd load the truck up with food and drive it back for their kitchen. And I met, you know, a lot of ravise because the Israeli army is kosher. The whole army is fed with food that meets the definitions of kosher. And these rabbis were out there watching everything and making sure that it was kosher. And the soldiers didn't like them too much. And I discovered that 80-90% of the income that comes to the revenue in Israel comes to them because of their supervision of the food system. And only 10% of their income comes about from teaching or doing weddings and funerals and, you know, or teaching the young or running synagogues or that sort of thing. And say, so they're the food cops in the country. And I look upon the organic movement as very similar. I said, yeah, I mean, and I get that the regulations around it are really are a little bit arbitrary in terms of what qualifies and what does it. And everything. I have a question on here, though, that I think is really interesting from Margaret. Margaret, did you want to ask it yourself about the clay or do you want me to read it? You can if you want to I'm literally just going to read your questions. So basically Margaret asks, I thought she's first of all, I want to give Margaret Crack. I think she's written very thoughtful throughout the entire book club process about your book. And she's had some really great questions. This one is living soil does not include clay because when we talk living soil being really a peat-based soilless media is what we're talking with, with a compost fraction. So because of that, one of the things that we've talked about, and this is the question that Hi guys asking, too, is we've talked about CEC in relation to peat-based media because as I understand it and I haven't conversations with Bryant Mason, who's an agronomist that specializes in soilless media. When we look at that Logan test, we can't really use the CEC as an acro, it's a closer to a measurement of soluble salts than it is to a measurement of cationic change capacity in the sense that it's not being held on a clay colloid, like or by humus, like we would see an actual soil. So it's really just an overall fertility measurement as I understand it. So let me ask you a question. Maybe you can help us both resolve this. You've seen a lot more soil tests on soilless media than I have. I've seen some, there was a period of a few years there when I advised, I don't know, maybe it doesn't people through build soil, who used to sell me, send me soil tests and I contact the grower and we'd have a long conversation on the telephone and I enjoyed it very much for a few years just getting a talk to all kinds of people. Yeah, but you've seen a lot more on, yeah, I mean Brandon does the bulk of our soil calculations right now and we probably get three to five a day. So yes, we're seeing a lot of these soil tests and one of the things we see is we always see higher organic matter, you know, it's going to be plus 20% which makes sense. And we always see, well, the CC will vary basically kind of more closely to the soluble soil level the soil than anything else. So we pretty much disregard that on the standard test in these P-based soils. We don't use that and we know that they're using that calculation for determining the level on the standard test, the levels of calcium, magnesium, all of that's correlated to that. So we pretty much move over to the saturated paste test for what's available to the plant and how we we're going to make our recommendations based off of that. So on the on the standard test, now I'm kind of getting a little off topic, but on the standard test, the main things that I look at are pH phosphorous reserves and then nitrates ammonium, I kind of just skip over a lot of that other stuff on the test because I don't find it to be as useful for making a recommendation than the stuff on the saturated paste. Well, I think it's correct me here, Steve, but I think the reason it's so high is because we're putting all of these seed meals in there, all these fertilizers and so they have a lot of cations in them, and so that's what's being reflected on this test similar to that soluble salt number. That's what I was the reason that you suffered, you know. Like it needs something in there. No, I always thought that Coco actually had a cation exchange capacity that was quite significant. Yes, we got to put out the calcium and magnesium, you have to like soak it and calm agged to buffer it as the hydrographers would say. Yeah, yeah, you want to load it up with calcium. That was my same system. That was my assumption before I had heard that it was like described more as a soup. And to Margaret, to Margaret's point, I think that one of the things in Steve talks about this in the book, when we are looking at, when the way that is tested done and the stronger the acid, the more of the calcium that's going to be liberated from lime and that kind of stuff is going to reflect as a false number. And so that's why we see that despite the fact that we don't have a clay colloid. I think that's what she's asking. Yeah, because they don't really count the C.C., right? They count the amount of calcium or something like that and then kind of. Let's see. Yeah, look, C.E.C. is just an arithmetic or calculation. That's all. I mean, the way that it's, the way that it's measured in a lab these days, you know, for soil testing purposes, they're just looking at how much how much available calcium magnesium, potassium and sodium that they find. And then they work out how many millilocal of it are. There are. And then they say that's what the C.E.C. is. And that can be very false. Tad is pointed out something that's useful to interpret there. He looks at the pH. And he looks at the E.C. And so if your pH is up over seven, what you know is you've got a lot of cat ions in solution. That's why the pH is high. So you could, you could probably practically Tad, I bet you could work this out. You could probably work out a arithmetic way of deflating the C.E.C. by the pH or by the E.C. or by both. So as they go up, you reduce the C.E.C. proportionately. You see, and maybe you can come up with a true picture of what the real C.E.C. might be. Oh. Well, is that so the whole way I've looked at a C.E.C. is that it's like a giant sponge. Yep. And it sends it like it's what the soil will hold on to. So if you have a high C.E.C. That soil's going to hold on to more cat ions and not going to just reach through the soil and end up in our in our water supply outdoors in the ray of real soil. And it takes more to fill that sponge. The larger that number is. But with when we're talking about soilist media and I apply fish meal, you know, I'm getting something with high nitrogen in there. That nitrogen, I would, well, nitrogen's a bag example, because it's an anion. Let me back up. Potassium. Potassium sulfate, let's say, for example. And I apply, so we have high levels of potassium going into that soil, that potassium is not being really per se bound up by anything. It's just being, it's more available to the plants. And it's sort of in solution in that soil as we maintain moisture content. Versus I would assume if we had like a high clay soil, we would have that that potassium may potentially be bonded to the clay or the or some other. Yeah. And how about another bio chart, can? Yeah. That's what I was pausing about was because of bio chart. I was thinking of that in my head.\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:10:58\n```\n does have an anion exchange capacity. Yeah. So, yeah. So that would be an excellent addition to any kind of growing medium. Oh, and I do. So I guess maybe this will, maybe this will be some kind of a market saying or maybe I'm totally off-base. But my thought was like, okay, if it isn't deet a sponge and we have to fill that sponge before the plant can access those nutrients. And then it will, you know, release organic acids to get more of those nutrients over time through its exidates. But in theory, we have to fill that sponge before we can start feeding the plant in a heavy clay soil. That's that's right. By the way, when I use bio chart, I pre-charge it and yeah, I like to pre-charge it with potassium and calcium. Okay. The research has been associated. You have to add some nitrogen to it. That's the biggest thing that it needs in order to keep it from robbing nitrogen from your plant. Yeah, I do that too inadvertently. But I'm more looking at the cations. And what I would do is I would use a mixture of complete chemical fertilizer in P.K. with heavy traces. And then I would also add a lot of gypsum. And then I would soak the crushed bio chart in the solution. Oh, and the solution would be three or four times stronger than I would ever put on a plant's root zone. And I let it soak up this solution. And I have seen it. I had a 25 gallon bucket. I have to remember to think in American measure. So in a five gallon bucket half full of crushed bio chart covered with this solution after a couple of months it's risen. And it's actually swell up. It's now occupying two thirds of the bucket rather than half. It's soaked up all of that. So then if you take that bio chart out of there, rinse it off just to get the solution off of it and let it dry. Wicked you've got our little granules of concentrated fertilizer that have a very high exchange capacity. And then man, the things grow when you put that in there. I know we're not really answering Margaret's concern. She's probably still wondering, what do I do? And when we don't know what to see. It is better in that it won't make your soil sticky and airless. It doesn't have the downsides of clay. And it's not heavy. See, one of the problems when you start putting clay into the soil medium is that the bulk density goes up. And now the containers get harder than deal with. Although if you're using these big beds like, you know, more and more growers are using live a living soil beds, the weight of the material in those beds is not really as important. It just means you may be at the use of a little more steel and bigger casters or something like that. But, you know, it's it's not a problem. I don't. Okay. I'm just looking at the other questions here to see if there's a good one in this regard. So, hi, Guy Gardner. You had a question about, we kind of covered the TCC. Did you want to ask about the P&K? Question you had on here? Hi, I was something I learned more for like pushing yields in earlier. You said that wasn't something you did. I can't find where I typed this question out because I thought about it before. He said, how do you feel about pushing P&K numbers for yields in the field soil? Go away we do in a peat base soil. Yes, the cannabis. Oh, okay. I'm glad I'm going to get a chance to take all this, you know, directly, rather than I was very blessed in my early years of learning how to grow into our cannabis. And because of the soil and health library and the soil and health conversation group and writing of the intelligent Gardner, one of the people who was sort of looking in the wings there was a fellow named Mike Critty. I think I've been having interactions with Mike in the last week. I'm still doing my good, you garden outside too, it's not for campus. So, okay, let's talk about Mike. Sure. I'm going to share with you what Mike taught me. Mike has had a long interest in cannabis, long, long interest. And he is married to a Peruvian lady and he lives in Lima for rule, at least the last I heard. And he made his living by consulting with large agricultural operations around Lima, growing irrigated fields of avocados and citrus and whatever and very alkaline highly mineralized soils. And he, he learned a lot of unique things. One of the things he especially learned about was gypsum. And he's a great lover of gypsum. So, when cannabis growing became legal in the state of Colorado, Mike began advising some of the early growers there. And he has a theory about cannabis nutrition that was developed very scientifically actually. The United States drug enforcement administration got a very smart, unquote, idea back in the 1970s that they could determine the country of Oregon, intercepted cannabis shipments by perhaps analyzing the profile of terpenes and cannibanoids in this particular sample. And then they could tell where it came from. So, to work that out, what they did was, is they got, I don't know, you know, like a pickup truck load and you've got a little girl sneaking up on you. Hello. My daughter. You can give me the interepers story. That's all right, I love children. Anyway, they got, they got, say, 14 pickup loads of soil from different places around the state of Maryland. And they ran the soil test on each, each different soil type. And then they grew, you know, 100 or 200 little cannabis plants from some land race seed that they'd seized somewhere and they grew a couple hundred plants in each one of these soil types. And then when the plants were, I don't know, you know, football, they harvested them, sent them to the lab and tested them for CBD for THC for blah, blah, blah. And they varied a lot. It was the same gene pool. It was the same broad sample in the plants. And the THC content of these immature plants varied anywhere from 3% to 6%. So, what made 6% instead of 3%. Well, when you look at the numbers on the soil tests, you see certain things in common. And my concluded from, from this, and by the way, if you ask Mike nicely, Ted, he probably sent you a PDF of this, of this, because it was published. Oh, Steve, Mike doesn't like me at all. Unfortunately, I posted something a while back years ago and he disagreed with it. And so I tried to have a polite discussion with him about it. And after three times asking him to stop insulting me, I said, I'm going to have to end this conversation and block you. And so I did. And then recently, I've made another post about calcium. And he sent going on to said some pretty nasty things about me. He's got a lot of opinions about calcium for sure. And he does. And I haven't said anything negative about him. Other than the fact that he doesn't seem to have to have a polite conversation about a topic without insulting someone. So, I'm sorry to him. I'm sorry that all those years of living abroad hasn't gotten Mike out of being an American. We're not always the most polite. I will give you that. No, yeah, I could tell you stories. I can spot American tourists off of the tourboat in Hobart from behind when they walk down the sidewalk. And I can be, you know, 15, 20 meters behind them. And they're just, you know, swaggering down the sidewalk with their arrogance. And I can say, hey, there's an American, you know, and you can see them. And they push to the front of the line. And they have no respect for anybody around them. And they are completely selfish. But anyways. So, Mike's idea. I'm sorry you don't get along with him. I mean, this is the scientific, listen, I'm sorry, Mike is like that. I've never seen that side of him. But anyway, Mike says, let me just cut to the bottom line. Mike says, one thing is essential when you're going into a cannabis is they have very high levels of available calcium at all times. And so people who've been using, you know, sulfate-based fertilizers indoor, you know, prepared fertilizers, they often have to use something called kelmag.\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:21:15\n```\n You know, in some growth shop here in Tasmania, they had a little electric sprayer. And every morning, the guy turned on the lights in his demonstration with a grow chambers and spray all the plants with kelmag. And they were just brilliant, looking. Before he didn't do that, they looked terrible. Calcium is just critical. So Mike thought that one way to deal with that would be to have gypsum in the growing media. gypsum, I was reading a book, what this guy's name, Russk, I think, Howard, he wrote the manual on raising food crops with hydroponics. Anyway, he had a list of solid abilities of various chemicals used in greenhouse hydroponics. And one of them was calcium sulfate. And believe it or not, calcium sulfate is soluble. But it's only very slightly soluble. And the concentration of the solution is very low. And you can't achieve a higher concentration than that. So if you put gypsum into your growing medium, what happens is that the soil water will develop a concentration of calcium, which equals that, and never any higher. But it just works out beautifully that that concentration is just perfect. And if you have that concentration of calcium sulfate in the soil solution, your plants will have quite adequate calcium at all times. So in that sense, it doesn't matter how much gypsum you put into the soil mix, you will not have a higher level of calcium in this solution than what you can get. So all the rest of it just sits here is inert particles. I got a theory. Yeah, we could get some gypsum that would have been crushed and was quite coarse. And so that it was airy. And what's served as a hydroponic medium, that we could use pure gypsum as a hydroponic growing medium. As long as this thing theory. Yeah, as long as the physical structure of the gypsum would allow there to be air and all that other stuff to go on. Yeah. So Mike did an experiment in early days in Colorado where he got a group of growers, to each one take a cut from the same mother and grow that cut in their own grow room and each one use more gypsum than the one previously. So they you know measured increased steps in gypsum concentration in the growing medium. And the one that used the most gypsum got the best result. So the gypsum as she has just got to keep releasing calcium and you release it out. You leach it out and it releases more and you leach it out. It just keeps releasing until it's all released. So you want to put in enough that it doesn't run out of gypsum before you're done with the grow. Yeah, yeah, I would agree with all of that. I mean, I think gypsum is calcium sulfate is is very important. It is a wonderful tool, I guess. And it's very hard to over apply because it doesn't put osmotic pressure. It doesn't raise your soluble salts dramatically, but it gives you calcium and sulfate. Two things that cannabis needs at good levels of efficiency and you really aren't going to get a sulfur toxicity from from that sulfate either. So I would totally agree with that. And yeah, we use gypsum quite a bit. The other thing with gypsum being that it's not raising your pH because of that sulfur component, which is really nice compared to egg lime. So we'll use a combination of a small amount of very, very fine agricultural lime at a lower concentration. And then a much higher level of gypsum in our initial mixes as a way of getting, you know, like you said, luxuries to efficiency levels of calcium without pushing our pH through the roof, like the egg lime does. Yeah, that's right. In fact, you might do just as well if you left the egg lime out completely. Okay. Because your problem is high pH. I mean, it can be, it can. Yeah, yeah, you want to put nutrients in there to the point that the pH starts going on. You're like, except we want, it's that you want a lot of phosphorus in there. We want luxury levels of phosphorus reserves, which are going to lower our pH as a way of allowing for good phosphorus availability throughout the whole cycle, because that is probably the hardest thing on the saturated paste is that for an organic grower is raising those p levels. Unless you're using a guano or something with phosphoric acid in it, like a fish. I draw a sage or something like that. Available pH is a little more challenging, I think, in that order. Yeah. Yeah, about phosphorus. Um, do you have access to what we call reactive rock phosphate? Is that what you're calling soft rock phosphate versus? No, it's a hard rock phosphate. But it's unusually, it has a very high percentage of calcium phosphate. I'm not aware of that as an available product. I haven't seen anything. Yeah, like that. The one, Erica, Erica mentioned a product. Some time ago, I'm trying to see if I have it. I think I made a bookmark for it. It's not coming up right away. I'm sorry. I don't want to waste your time with this. Well, that's okay. I know we're running out of time too. One thing I want to touch on, though, too, with, with all of these amendments, um, you know, gypsum, but it's more specifically soft rock phosphate. All of these in mind products and even the basalt and rock dust, you know, that you've talked about is heavy metals. And that's a big issue now for us as Canvas grows. It's something we have to be aware of that we was never even on our radar a decade ago. Yeah. So, uh, oh, here's someone posted it out. Yeah. And by the way, that's the company. That's there in Melbourne. Yeah. And this guy is a very sophisticated buyer of rock phosphate. That's all. And he knows exactly which mine he wants to buy from. And so he comes up with a phosphate, hard rock phosphate, which is very high in calcium phosphate. And it releases a lot of phosphorus over 18 months or so. Hmm. I would just be concerned about heavy metal. As with any I would check heavy metal. I would too. And when I started messing with this stuff, uh, I did some research and discovered that, uh, dairy operations, people who milk milk farms, uh, they feed calcium phosphate as a food supplement. Hmm. So, uh, I went to the local farm supply and after you got it and they said, yeah. And it turns out to be that it doesn't cost very differently than the best forms of guano, uh, and yet it's a synthetic. And when I did the research, I discovered warnings about using this stuff that it could have high levels of heavy metals, uh, but then again, they're feeding it to dairy cows. Well, that I mean, I don't know that that's it necessarily. Right. I don't know that we can expect that our authorities are going to protect us against anything these days. Yeah. Unfortunately, nobody will protect us against them. Oh. Yeah. Well, well, here in America, I mean, we're not testing nearly that stringently for heavy metals in our vegetables. And and something that I've possibly had multiple times is, and my better off buying a California hydroponically greenhouse grown tomato, or paying a premium for a Mexican organically grown tomato that may have been grown up right next to a sewage process in facility, or a lumber mill, or aluminum smelter, or something else that may be contaminating, you know, the crop with heavy metals, even though they used organic practices. And frankly, I don't know the answer to that. And it's frustrating. I wish we had a nutrient-dense section, a heavy metal, a low heavy metal section in the grocery store. Those will be wonderful. The answer is get yourself a solid tunnel and eat tomatoes in the summer, and give it up the rest of the year. Yeah, we do need to eat season 1. Don't eat them in the winter. That's all. Yeah, eat your own, and when you don't have them, don't eat them. I wish I could get my wife to she keeps buying these disgusting tomatoes in the supermarket. Excuse me. I'm speaking Australia. Oh, tomatoes. I've trade myself to say that. So Steve, getting back to your, I guess, you know, since running out of time, the last question I have is, is getting back to your book, the intelligent gardener? All right. What do you think are the high level, the main points that you would want to apply to a cannabis grow or growing and living soil, like, besides something like, you know, like, test your soil. For example, you can still test your soil. That would be one. Yeah, I would think. Yeah, you can test your soil. You can bring your soil to look like the best example of what I would want to grow vegetables in. So you can do that as though you're growing outdoors. Then you can assume that your plants are probably going to run out of roots own. And so you could use not very strong soluble fertilizer that was as balanced as possible in all water given. You couldn't perhaps not use that fertilizer until the plants were pretty well done veggie, although if they run, if they, I always assume that the plants root system is as big as the plants tall. So it'll extend in radius from the base of the plant out\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:31:26\n```\n medium will be pretty well ramified with roots. And once that happens, you want to start feeding it intentionally. You put a lot of gypsum in there to make sure you're going to run out of calcium a lot, like, you know, let's say 35 liter pot. I'm going to get on with that be 10 gallons. So in a 10 gallon pot, I would use an entire team of foliage up some like 250, 300 milliliters a whole cup full, a generous cup full of gypsum in that pot. That's probably seems like a lot to you. But yeah, you could use two cups. You could use, you could use a gallon. It really wouldn't matter as long as it didn't change your soil texture. And it would make your stuff heavier or make your containers way more. But anyway, you'd use a lot of gypsum. Whatever the fertilizer you're using, if you're using it, this prepared use it at a half to a third of the concentration that assists on the label. As a general rule, once you've changed the leaves, once you've caused the, when you start killing cells on the plant, with too much that you see, you can't make it up. There's no back enough from that. So you're always better off with less than more when it comes to fertilizer. There's a source of fertilizer that I'd like to recommend to you. Where is it? Sorry about this, Ted. I know this is contradicts you or business. No, man. It's fine. We're open to whatever. Yeah. Yeah. I've got a link to it here. I'm trying to find it. There's a company in Canada. I may have the send this to you later, Ted. I don't want to waste everybody's time. All I keep looking for this. Oh, there it is. Oh. On a second. I'll get it. No, you can put it right into the chat. You just, where do I put it on the chat? Down at the bottom of the chat, but there should be a little box where you can put in a message. Notes. It's not called notes online, but you can. No, that isn't it. Oh. We can add it later, too. But basically, you want to run a larger container. And then you want to feed some sort of mineral salt program at light levels to maintain fertility because the, you feel the plant runs out of room in the roots. Can't feed the way they need to as well, just because of lack of root space. That's right. That's really that simple. What I was trying to share with you is that in Australia, we have somebody that John camped with the imitates. John Camps. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Graham State. I know Graham. Yeah. Graham is a wonderful fellow. I had lunch with Graham one day in Sydney. I went all the way up there. Just they have lunch for them. Oh. Anyway, Graham sells a product called triple 10. And you should look into it. And there's a company in Canada that distributes it. They're called Agress Agsol, AGSOL Canada. I'm just can't find out anywhere on this page to post it. Anyway, it's AgsolCanada.com, AGSOL Canada. And they sell triple 10 and some other new protect products as well. And I know this doesn't sort of fit the philosophical definition of KIS organics. But there you got it. Yeah. But I think this is a product you want to sell. And they have another really cool product that the Canadian people have an imported, but they sure that it's called phosphores. And phosphores is a made by reacting calcium nitrate with phosphoresac acid. And a few other things. And it provides MPK and it's very acidic. It's like pH is 1.5 or something like that. So sometimes I have to use potassium hydroxide when I use phosphores to get the pH up within reasonable range. But then it's low in potassium. So adding a little potassium, hydroxide is all the good. Anyway, this stuff enormously raises bricks. And triple 10 is not like anything I've ever found in the states for liquid concentrates because everything is complex. Everything, all the trade settlements. And there's a lot of other juicy little things in there. You know, natural plant growth hormones and nothing harmful, but you know, what's that one that everybody was all hot about a couple of years ago? The name is escaping me. Anyway, I use this though. Gramsate says that it should be used to 10 mills to the leader. I think it's better at two mills to the leader. Okay. Yeah. It's compatible with a few things. So you can actually adjust the MPK. Oh, that is the other thing that I wanted to share with you about my query. My belief that if you were supplementing your grow with concentrates, that the MPK that the ratio that you should be targeting is one, two, two, doing grow. Okay. Two phosphorus, two potassium, one nitrogen. Plus, you know, luxury traces. When you get in a bloom, you have a sort of a fork in a road and you can make a choice. If you're the typical commercial grower, you can push that ratio to one, two, three. Now you start really pushing potassium. The plants use the potassium to build more biomass. They make fiber with it. The buds get bigger and heavier and less potent. But you make more money. Okay. No, I've got a lot more biomass to but if you want the highest quality product, then you change the ratio to one, two, one in bloom and you're cut the potassium in a level way down. And now you get small rock hard fragrant little buds that are a bit more potent. Isn't that post-ipotency, though, related more to dilution factor? The idea being that the plant can only produce so many cannabinoids. That's it. And so at some point if you're getting more biomass, it's essentially spreading that out over a greater surface area. Yeah, that would be my guess, too, too. So we still push potassium because overall we find it in flower. It does exactly what you said. We get a bit more biomass, we get denser, bigger healthier plants and buds overall versus. And I would speculate that the the big difference in a lot of these peabusters that we saw because for a while, you know, it was nitrogen and in veg and phosphorus and bloom, I think it's really more about k in a lot of ways. So we like to do a little bit of k mid cycle, mid-flower cycle, through potassium sulfate is a way of just keeping those levels up, provided. Yeah, it will do that. I would like to make a suggestion to you. I know you have a grown room, and I know you've got these living soil beds. Why don't you just take one bed in the back corner and make a special reservoir for it? And hand water, hand fertilize water, and change your NPK ratio in that bed to one to one during bloom and then call that bed my own for personal use. And see what happens. That would be interesting. So if you like hard to commit a whole bed, but I will give it some thought. Yeah, I mean, I'm all for experimenting. I think it's a good idea to do trials of all coins. So you would want double the level of available P, then what you have of k. That's what you're saying. That's right. On a saturated test, in theory, it would be the same. Oh, then I don't know. I mean, how the saturated paste has can relate to what the military extraction says or relative to what you're putting into the soil, I have to tell you, I don't know. So when you say double, that's what I'm one of, where, you know, one to one. What I'm wondering is, are you saying about watering with that, assuming all other things are it's right? That's right. You're talking about what to put in, not what the plants can experience. Okay. I just wonder what's already in there and how that factors in. Yes, it does. The equation. So yes, it does. I'm sorry. I don't have an answer for you. Okay. Yeah. Oh, there's one other thing. I don't feel that I'm running out of time. The, I'm having fun. The NutriTek, NutriTek has two other, a couple other products. I want to tell you about. You may find them in the United States, something like it. One is called Fast Life, HLSLAFE. And what this is is this is guano, high phosphorus guano that's ground to nano particle size. And then mixed with water and citric acid. And it looks like house paint.\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:41:40\n```\n and it has to be re-educated with electric drill driven paint mixer or something like that. This stuff has the biggest effect that you can never imagine. And it's completely non-ionic. You see, now they've got another product, which is even more interesting in some ways. And they call this stuff a die-life. And this is diatom shells, diatomaceous earth that's ground to nano particle size and mixed with water and they add to it a little boron. And we kind of already have that here. What does it mean? Well, not in the sense that it's not mixed with boron, but I feel like you could easily make this based off. Because the, the diatomaceous earth that we get here is so fine and soluble already. And so a fortified, I feel like mixing that with a little bit of water and all the soluble, you could probably recreate what you're saying. But yeah, you might try that. I don't know if it's fine enough. The propaganda on gram-sates website is that by grinding it, this fineness is actually capable of going right through the cell membranes and into the cell. And it's not ionic. I will tell you this, that when I treat plants with potassium silicate, I get a little result. When I treat them with die-life, I get a big result. And the only problem with using die-life is that when you've got muds forming, if you spray it, you're going to end up with little spots of, of, um, um, um, diatomaceous earth sticking to the surfaces of the plant. So you, it might not make it good for selling the flower. If it's got diatomaceous earth on it. But, um, if you get the silicon level of the plant up really high up to the point that it's just starting to form buds, I, I gauge the result of it by how stiff the branches are. And if I got a plant out there, it seems like the branches are bendable, too bendable. And so that when it's got the way to flower on it at the end of the season, they may bend down or break, uh, if I get a bit of rain shower, or something like that, uh, you spray it with silicon and it hits a lot more durable plant. And also makes the plant relatively immune, uh, to mold. So if you've got a real high silicon level in your flowers, you don't have as much trouble with mold at the end. Uh, so I pushed die-life and, uh, I tried just using marble last night in your soil though. And, and potassium silicon, too, you know, very affordable forms of, uh, of the silicon, or, or even getting in, uh, you know, just using diatomaceous earth that's very finely ground and micronized. No, I've never tried thought of using diatomaceous earth. Uh, what was the first thing you said the word, Roko? So, uh, okay. So first off, with diatomaceous earth, uh, there was a silica researcher I had on the podcast who, who said that there is a lot of available silicon that gets released from that. So that is something you could use as a, as an SI source, um, and the, and particle size obviously determines release rates. And so the stuff that, like, we can buy, um, ourselves that we can source through distributors is, it looks like flower. It's very, very fine. And it, it turns to mud with you at water. Um, so you're putting that into your living soil there. You could. We haven't, we haven't started. We've been using, uh, we'll last tonight, which also very fine particle size. Oh, that was the first item you meant. And I didn't have the word well enough. Yeah, I won't permit it with the last tonight. Yeah. So we've been using that, um, a fair bit is a way of raising silica levels in, in the soil each side, too. Anyway, we're all recognizing that silicon is really important. Yeah. Yeah. But, um, no, it's interesting. I'm not familiar with these products being here in the United States. So yeah, maybe folks will be able to track them down. Good. Good. Yeah. And I, I had a, our conversation with, uh, these people in Canada and urge them to please bring in the sponsors, uh, and, uh, there would be good also if they brought in postlife, uh, and, uh, Graham got onto that. And he contacted me and he said, hey, uh, about this postlife, he said, if you'd like, we can make it with different NKK ratios. Yeah. You know, he must think that I know I'm all set up to buy, you know, a hundred thousand leaders of it or something. Uh, yeah. Yeah. No, he definitely has a, uh, a large product list and, uh, does a good job of promoting what, just comes with you and what he's selling. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. He needs an American distributor. You know, so, Steve, between you and me, like our big thing is like trying to move people away from a lot of these products by using soil testing as a way of targeted amendments to their soil, so they can just use ship some or fishbone meal or, right. Hey, glad. You know, depending on what the soil test is showing us that we don't have to buy. It's right. It's a good thing you're doing. Yeah. I'm all in favor of it. I'm so sorry. You're not, you will admit it's not the only way to do it. Oh, no, no. It's definitely not. Definitely not. There's a lot of ways to grow this plants, um, uh, absolutely. And then, yeah, I mean, I would argue it might be one of the more sustainable ways of doing it. But at the end of the day, I've seen healthy plants grown with mineral salts. I've seen healthy plants grown with, you know, just compost and good soil. I've seen, you know, just about everything. So I don't want to suggest that the way that we do it is the only way I'd, that is not the case at all. By the way, I want to show you something. I just harvested this the other day. Um, this is off of a dwarf autoflor, which, you know, I had a few of them out there. But this flower is not what you think. It's him. Okay. Yeah. I'm a licensed hemp grower. So I'm allowed to possess this. It's legal. This doesn't have CBD in it. This has CBD. I don't know if you're familiar with CBD, but you should be. It's the most wonderful stuff. Um, it, it, uh, uh, if you know how people will sometimes mix cannabis with tobacco. Yes. I don't do that. I don't like it. I don't use tobacco ever since I got off my addiction to it. You know, at age 28, there's no way you'd ever get me to play around with tobacco again. Um, but anyhow, you can mix flower cannabis with CBD. And you could put, uh, 10, 15, 20 percent of this in your, in your joy or your pipe or what have you, along with whatever you're doing. And the consequence would be that the stone, the high, would last a lot longer. Uh, and if you had a propensity to pair a noia, it wouldn't happen. Uh, and it would make everything a lot narrower. Uh, um, one of the things CBD does, uh, is it increases the level of an animal in your body. Hmm. So an animal, you know, that used to be called in Dorfins when I was your age. Uh, it's the runner's high. It's what you get when you're hyperventilating, you know, burn a lot oxygen for more than 20 minutes. Uh, and your, your body starts releasing, uh, and this chemical, then you get stone out of your face. And nothing hurts anymore. And you could run forever. And life is a breeze and it's boat potent and heroin. It's wonderful stuff. Um, is a bell. My previous wife, uh, uh, she was in a, in Dorfins addict. The only way she could get through the day was by releasing some endorphins in the morning. And so for that reason, she had to be a triathlete. Still, that's her body didn't hurt down. Right. Anyway, this stuff does that. So every morning, I get up and I take a little score to the extract of CBG. And it makes me feel resilient. Kind of like I could deal with some horrible stress, you know, and I'd handle it like one was your age, rather than I'm like 80. And that's amazing. And you know, I know, you just done a some CBG season. Yeah, thank you. You, you can buy them. Um, Oregon CBD. Oh, yeah, I'm familiar. Seth Crawford, I think, is the gentleman's name that. Yeah. There's, there's several of our CBG. We're, we're trialing a variety right now at the farm. And I have some plants in my garden is called DBLCBG double CBG. Um, and this plant produces an excess of 50, 15% CBG by dry weight, um, which is pretty good yield, uh, and, uh, it's very resonance and terpy. So when you smoke this flower, then I showed you it's really, very pleasant to smoke very mild, uh, slightly terpy taste. Uh, you don't get stoned when you smoke it, uh, but I've long felt that the direction of the cannabis industry for personal use is going to be pre-rolls if you want to smoke. Um, and it's going to be a lot like going into the liquor store. Um, you know, when you go to the liquor store and you go to the whiskey department, uh, on the bottom shelf, there's all this really cheap stuff for the bit less alcohol in it. Um, it gives you a terrible hangover often gets a lot of advertisement in the young people buy it, you know, things like gym beam and jack Daniels and other kinds of rubbish. Uh, and then there's the middle shelf stuff which is blended Scotch and, you know, uh, of better quality bourbons, uh, and they're always the same and the prices moderate and they don't give you bad hangover, it always works and it's going to go into McDonald's. It's always the same. Um, and then on the top shelf, they have 10-year-old\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:51:47\n```\n that. So, uh, I think what's going to happen in the industry is that your average person is just going to want to get stoned. And they want to know when they buy a package of joints, this particular label on them that they're going to be this way, always, uh, and it's always going to be decent experience and they're not looking for the finest refinements of subtlety. Uh, they just want to get dope, um, and it's going to be relatively cheap. And I think that's what the business is going to sell the most smokeables. Um, and they'll make those. They'll just take something like this CBD flower or CBD flower and spray some, you know, spray an extra active THC on it, and they'll be the potency you want. And if it doesn't taste the way you want it, they'll spray it with a bit of turpines. And, you know, it'll be like Johnny Walker-Rag or, you know, teachers or bellon tines and always be that. Um, that's one of the industries going to go, and that's the biggest going to be the biggest. Another one might be puffers by the way. You know, we'll see, I mean, we already have kind of stratification in the industry here with the market, um, in terms of quality and the companies that are surviving, some of the companies are just pumping out as much as they can at the cheapest price. And other people are doing, you know, going for that top shelf level, but it definitely does, it does very quite a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What an interesting time to watch this industry is. Oh, I'm getting, I'm getting yelled at by my daughter here. I skipped dinner already. So time for that. Maybe we should wrap this up. I know other people probably have to get going to, but I really thank you for your time today. I, I really enjoyed the conversation. I thought the stuff around the CC was really interesting, and I loved hearing your perspective on just sort of your life experience. So thank you. Yeah. Well, it's been a pleasure. And any time you want to talk about anything else, let me know. I will. I will. Absolutely. All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Thanks, everybody. Thanks, Steve. Okay. Thanks. I know. Yeah. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. What? All right. Good night. Good night.", "id": "ac622883-be92-424a-9e22-c28eda4fad69"}

We're going to get a big echo. You have to mute. I know. She's going... Okay. We've got you. So I'll give a little background. Anybody I can fill in here in the gaps while he plays around with the camera. My parents founded a landscaping company called Sunset Gardens way back in the day. And that's when they met Don Marshall. He had been a landscaper prior to starting the horticulture program at Lake Washington College. And then after Sunset Gardens, they started Classic Nursery together, which was a landscaping and nursery on Seven Acres, where we eventually turned into Kiss Farm. So been around plants my whole life, grew up on a nursery. After they sold the Classic Nursery, my dad really wanted... He was getting into compost tea. And everything that Dr. Adam was doing. Yeah, it's frozen. Okay, here, take it. Okay, so here. Okay. He started a compost tea company called Simplicity, which was spelled... This was at the very beginning of the internet. So it was spelled S-I-M-P-L-I-C-I-T-E-A.com. It was the hardest website to find. But we had... We had the only 12-hour compost tea brewer on the market, according to all the testing that he did with Dr. Elaine Ingham. And he was one of the very first Soul Food Web Advisors. And he was doing that. And my mom was helping him run that side of the business. They were spraying compost tea and also doing the online sales of these five-gallon brewers and building these 28-gallon and 55-gallon brewers. And then I came into the business. Because I came back from Australia with a master's in special education. I couldn't find a job. Didn't know what I was going to do. And they allowed me to come in and work with them. So I learned all about compost tea. And then from there, we started selling amendments. Because I was part of the ICMA group, an organic soil. And I was finding that I wanted to be able to make soils for cannabis, like what we now call living soils. And we couldn't find five pounds of kelp anywhere. You had to buy everything in 50%. You had to buy everything in town quantities.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:03:00\n```\n And then after that, made a soil. My dad got really into biochar and worked with Contiki Kilns. And went to China and toured around and talked to the Department of Forestry in Oregon around biochar and some of the benefits of biochar. And now he's retired. I'm running. Kiss Organics. We've shut down Kiss Farm. And yeah, I think that's the latest. So if any of that sparks any interest or questions, my dad used to make our composts for the compost tea stuff. He set up the biochar stuff as well as all the compost tea things. So yeah, that's all I have. I don't know. Dad, did you want to share anything? People have any questions? How did you guys end up in Redmond? I didn't hear the question. How did you? Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Brendan. Sorry. How did you end up in Redmond? If you want to just kind of tell us your organic story. Tell us your story. Yeah. Yes, please. Yes, please. I was a farm going, real interested in soils, having followed, what was his name? It's breaking up a little bit. Are you talking about One Straw Revolution, Dad? Fukuoka? Yeah, it is breaking up quite a bit. Can you hear me? I can hear you. I can hear you. Do you maybe turn the camera off? Is the other router, the other Starlink router, is that unplugged? Yeah, it's frozen. I can't move to the living room. Yeah, he needs to be in the living room and the other router has to be unplugged probably. Okay. All right. Maybe, can you hear us okay? Leon, maybe try turning the video off. It might help with the bandwidth. I don't know that he can figure that out. It took us so long to get it on. Maybe if mom turns off her video or her connection, that might help too. You guys could be on the same one. Maybe cut down on the amount of data you're using.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:06:06\n```\n I can finally hear you. You're still breaking up a little bit. Yeah. Okay. Can you, you were saying, were you talking about One Straw Revolution, Dad? Yeah. The soil. And, you know, because we'd moved down. I, the culture ain't, dad, this isn't working. Leon can you hear me? Your, your video is freezing. There should be a video camera in the bottom left of the phone. Tap it. So it turns your video off. And then I think we'll be able to hear. you happen maybe maybe uh maybe mom can help you i thought she just left the call yeah if you tap that video camera it should get a red bar through it and your camera will turn off and we should get some more bandwidth and then we'll be able to hear you i can stop the video i'm doing it now hold on okay okay um okay can you guys hear us now any better uh-oh so we hear him okay we can hear you touch is anything i know oh it's breaking up really badly oh okay so uh it has nothing to do with the yeah sorry for the oh they're not bad yeah all right are you sure you're connected to uh wi-fi and can you hear him can you hear us now this phone off okay are you talking yeah this isn't working hold the phone like this mom are you able to hear us mom mom mom mom there's enough juice there is is this running through your hearing aid right now disabled the video yeah that's fine\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:09:12\n```\n i'm not doing anything that's fine we can hear you now can you just can you talk hey can you hear him thanks john uh no we we're you're cutting in and out can you hear yes yeah you you signal oh geez this is a nightmare um dad are you talking right now are you able to say anything what one thing you could try doing leaving and rejoining make sure that you only have the one starlink router on you could even try restarting it and then it should work well it's real intermittent it sounds like well we can hear you now let's try okay yeah yeah whatever you're doing stand on that one foot or whatever don't move but yeah just tell us your uh your organic journey how'd you end up in redmond was the first question we ended up in redmond um because mom wanted to be near her grandparents and her mother and father so we moved down to redmond and the uh i ended up getting a job with the lake washington school district on the maintenance through and at the same time we bought property ten and a half acres raw land no road to it no power nothing um which we started the process of building a road and building a house at the same time i went back to school and got a two-year degree in horticulture because i'd been laid off at the school district i was the last one hired in the first one laid off so after i finished the two years of uh by the time i finished the two years of horticulture i had about 15 maintenance counts in seattle redmond medina uh which is the rich area that bill gates lives in and started taking care of uh gardens maintenance wise and then got into landscaping and then eventually lynn and i and a friend doug hansen engineer with rocket research decided that we were going to um start up a a retail nursery and do um so we start up the retail nursery which we did it was all of the inventory was\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:12:22\n```\n and then we did that for a number of years and then ended up selling selling selling the business not the land for and so 10 years later we came back and it was during that 10 years that we were gone that i was developing the compost tea brewer going to china a couple times and then eventually working with monrovia with the five gallon brewer that we had i developed over there in china um which was two or three trips so and then at the same time i had been um i i i saw there was a class being offered this would have been about 19 about the year 2000 saw that there was a class being offered down in portland oregon which is about three miles away by dr elaine ingham on the soil food web so i went down and spent a day in portland took the class then ended up getting involved with her and saw my first brewer that had been developed by a man in cottage cottage something cottage lake it's um not far from corvallis bruce um not far from corvallis bruce unmasked or micro Caitlin's house he was bruce elliott and my client base was primarily evidential that i was doing probably 100 consoles a year and telling people what their plants we're with your soul word was but to move it didn't take any notes they had to do all the recording so i brand I had to go down, I took the class from Elaine, and then started developing the five-gallon brewer, because that's where I saw the greatest need. It was going through these housing developments, and I felt like I was going through a refugee camp with all the plants were diseased, everything. So, ended up building a trailer, 300-gallon tank sprayer, 200 feet of hose, and started doing the compost tea. And then I'd also flown, I drove into, or into Idaho, and had drawings. I had drawings made up for a 500-gallon stainless steel brewer, which I had made in Idaho, had\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:15:32\n```\n didn't work out in California. So, then I started spraying compost tea locally, doing trade shows with Monrovia at the same time. So, that was the first time that I was at the farmer's market, every weekend in Redmond. So, that's kind of, yeah, and then we also had a winery, Badger Mountain, that bought one of the big commercial brewers, because he couldn't get any fungal numbers on anything else in the market. And he was able to take care of what was mildew and something else, Badger Mountain. Yeah, anyway. It was an interesting journey. I went back to South Dakota, a guy that I helped him set up a 3,000-gallon brewer, stainless steel, when I saw what he had, because he was doing some practice out of Japan. Bakashi, I think? Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. And people were flying in from this company to keep him going. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was a huge, huge farm. And I told him the first thing he had to do was cut the top off of it. We needed air, and that kind of freaked him out. He climbed a ladder to get down inside of it. So, he and I told him he had to get a small trailer, set up a microscope. He had been a graduate of agriculture from Iowa State, Ohio? Ohio State. Ohio State. And he ended up increasing the bricks on his sugar beets, I think he said 12%. So, that was 12% more profit, because they get paid by the sugar content of their sugar beets and size. So, I was kind of traveling around. I also went and saved the Amish for three days. That was quite the experience. I didn't know until later on that no one stays with the Amish in their homes. And I was, they had 13 kids in the family, one girl. And when I went, I... The second time I went to visit them, I had a package delivered, big box, and I had baseball gloves, baseballs, bats, you know, a whole bunch of stuff. And then I opened it that night for supper, sitting in a rocking chair and all these kids\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:18:39\n```\n And this box had arrived four days before I had, with a note that it was not to be opened. So, they were all very eager. So, I opened it up, took out some preservatives, which we had for supper, and I also took out 15 pairs of chopsticks. And we all had supper that night, and that was very entertaining. They had never even heard about the Japanese before, let alone chopsticks. So, some interesting experiences on this. So, Leon, can I ask, were you there to learn their farming practices? Were you there teaching them something, or a little bit of both, or...? No, I was setting up a brewer that would run off of compressed air, not electricity. Oh, wow. Because they can do that, but they can't do electricity. So, I spent almost a year speaking with him on the phone, and his phone was out at the end of his driveway, because he couldn't have it technically on the property. So, that was interesting. Yeah. Yeah. No, he and I experimented over the phone for almost a year, and then I went out to visit after he got it built. And it was all new to me, because I'm used to electricity and, you know... Yeah. Horsepower. Anyway. So... So, I was busy flying around doing things, and trying to figure out how to have, how to make a really good compost and a really good tea, and the compost was really just getting high fungal mass, and the way to get the good value on the compost tea was you had to, which we figured out and we paid for in the lab. You had to be, I think it was 6% oxygen, dissolved oxygen, so what I figured out, you have to lift the water column... You measure where the top of the water column is on whatever container you have that you're using as a brewer, and then you have to lift that water column at least two, if not three inches, and in the big brewer in South Dakota, we lifted that water column six inches, and that was... It was a three-phase blower, I think it was a 10 horsepower, I'm not sure, but he had to redo his whole system for us, for me, and you have to realize, I'm making this up as I go along, because Soil Food Web, Elaine Ingham doesn't know what's going on, nobody's\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:21:42\n```\n the bacteria and everything else. And the thing that I think we learned through the process is you just put out a broad spectrum of biology, and whatever's there, we'll take advantage of it and use it or not. So it's the final decision, it's not up to us on what's used on the property. So one of the really interesting things that had happened... I was... Over Lake is a golf course that Lynn, my wife's father, helped design the greens on, and one of the homes overlooking that had large trees on it that blocked a neighbor's view of the 15th green. So half of that pine disappeared. One whole side was cut off with branches that were probably 10 and 12 inch diameter, so big branches. So we... Sprayed one of them with compost tea and the other one we didn't, pretty much identical. And the one with compost tea, the tree healed over a lot faster. And I pointed that out to a couple of arborists, but they weren't very interested, unfortunately. But you could really see that adding that biology, even though it was the biology from the soil, it really helped the tree heal its wound and cover it. So anyway, that's a lot of randomness from me to talking. Any questions? Yes. Go ahead, Brandon. Does anybody have any questions? I've got a bunch of loaded questions, because I see Leon several times a week. He does a lot of gardens out here. And so I've got loaded questions, but I wanted to see if anybody else... Okay. Allison? Question? No? Anybody? Okay. Well, I'll ask you a couple of questions, Leon. Okay. Good. Yeah. Yeah. So I know that you have certain plants that you like. I know that you like the sedums. I know that you like a wide variety of vegetables and row crop style stuff. But what got you... Ferns were my first plant that I just was... I couldn't stop thinking about it. It was such an amazing looking life form to me. And then when I found out how old they were and how they reproduce, and it sounded like this alien thing. And as a young kid, that lit a fire in me and I loved plants ever since then. What was your moment? Did you always love plants or is there... You know I have a begonia addiction. Is there a plant... Yeah. Yeah.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:24:48\n```\n Which I don't understand that. But anyway. Most people don't. Yeah. I'd always... I'm ADHD. So I'm very active outside. I'm better off outside than inside. And so the natural world had always kind of intrigued me. But I didn't have a very good formal education to really understand the pieces and how everything, as far as we know, how everything works. And I think that's what got me into it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then I just started to really understand how everything works. So it was really probably the plant would be a Metasequoia and it was from somebody who actually lived across the street where we eventually had our nursery. And he was a blueberry farmer half a year and the other half a year he was a horticulturalist. He was an engineer on a, for fueling boats. So he would probably be about 150 now, maybe 100. So it would be a long time ago. It would be when I was 20 and I'm 76 now. So he was an old man then. And he introduced me to cuttings off of a tree, metasequoia. And the history of the metasequoia is that it was the link between deciduous and evergreen. And just a few were found in China, which then became plants that people shipped all over the world. So I sort of got introduced to some of the, I don't know the right word. It wouldn't be spiritual. It would be. Just some of the magic of plants, how they can survive. So that was really it. And then I got into the soil and I'm still happiest when I'm weeding. And we have a number of other people's homes that we weed when they're not around. So anyway. And a spot on Maristone. Yes. Was somebody else speaking up? I didn't. Well, I have a question. Yes. I was wondering about teas that in the book, this Teeming with Micros book thing, when they're talking about compost teas. Right. They mentioned things about certain fungi that help prevent powdery mildew. Or downy mildew or gray snow with names. I can't pronounce, but there's ones for turfs or rhododendrons, he mentions. And I was wondering if you've done anything for targeting compost teas for pest prevention.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:27:58\n```\n It's all preventative. And that's what we found with Badger Mountain on his vineyard. Because I think once you start seeing an infestation, it becomes a lot more difficult. Yeah. Because Tad was mentioning in his podcast that like powdery mildew, you know, surprisingly the same, the same type is on our cucumber, you know, on our, you know, whatever those calls vegetables as it is on the cannabis plants. And so I was wondering if, if there, if we. Emphasize that fungi, that it would be, you know, perhaps help bend them away here in the Pacific Northwest at least. Yeah, you'd probably have to, you know, that, that all makes sense, but your delivery system is going to be really important. And then one of the things we always found was using a surfactant. Okay. Spreader sticker. When you mean delivery. delivery system, could you be a little bit more detailed, please? Oh, I just, it's just that whatever you're spraying, I think needs to be a real fine mist. Okay. And not a hard jet where you could be knocking plants off. I know there were a couple of properties in Medina that I took care of. Um, and we never had any, uh, disease issues, but then we were also doing, uh, root soak, root soaking, root injections on the maples and on the trees. We were doing, uh, foliar every month during the growing season. And I would put down on this five acre site, I would put down 300 gallons of tea. Okay. Wow. Okay. Uh, the landscaping alone was $3 million. How often did you do that? Uh, how many times did you do it throughout the year? Just during, just during the growing season, when you get that early push in the spring, uh, when nighttime temperatures are over, um, just start to be over 40 degrees, because that seems to be the temperature that the soil. The soil sort of wakes up and everything starts working. And then we would do that right through, uh, October. And how often was it like once a month or? Once a month. Yeah. I'd show up and do that. Um, he, he did a number of, uh, John did a number of transplants of large plants. I mean, Japanese, Laisley, Japanese maple, which is the weeping one that would have a five, six foot spread, uh, diameter of 10, 12 inches.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:31:07\n```\n Oh, wow. Uh, so then I would come in right after they were planted and I do, uh, root injections and the root injections was the same that I would normally spray, except I would add to the root injections. I'd already have the tea made up. And it would be bubbling in the 300 gallons. And then I would add injections or anything going into the soil. I would add, um, molasses, blackstrap molasses. So, but you're making that with the tea, right? When you say add the molasses, is that post when you're actually applying it to, or was it when you were making it? No, no. When I was applying it. Oh, okay. Because, because you can. And we also used a little bit of molasses when we started the, the 24 hour brew. But, uh, the reason for the molasses that application was just putting more food out. Um, and we worried at all that they would, they would reproduce too much and start, oh, I guess you wouldn't be, you know, I was thinking maybe you wouldn't want it to explode that much with bacteria population, but I don't know. Yeah, I don't know either. It was just additional food. Um, and it seemed, you know, you've got a, a water that you're carrying it all in. So with the root injections, you're able to put everything right down. Okay. The mine was, my mine is about two and a half feet long, so I could push it down about two feet around the root mass around these plants. Um, so you have a special stick and you just stick it in and, and some, some of the tea gets in near the root. Yeah. What, what, what you have is a, uh, a wand that's about three feet long and you have a hose coming from the tank and there's a motor that pressurizes that hose. So it, the, it's just like a pressure washer, except you've got tea and you've got a three foot one that goes down into the ground. Oh, okay. Depending upon the soil. And if it's something that's just been planted, you have a three, you have a, a depth of about two and a half feet around that big root ball that's loose soil. So you're able to just, um, get not only the organisms, but also the food source down there. And, and we also found that dependent upon what foods you use during the Bruce brewing process. So that really determines what biology can be amplified, but the, um, that population is changing all the time.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:34:12\n```\n So. Did you ever target certain, certain types or, uh, certain types of fungi or bacteria, or can you not really do that too effectively since they, when, um, when I was doing that? There wasn't much information out there. Okay. On what was what? Um, How were you composting dad? That might be more useful in terms of how you, because that was really what controlled the biology in your tea was what we started with. Well, that's true. And I tried a number of different things and then what we actually ended up with was a rotating barrel that lays on its side, uh, that you could open from the side and then you could stand and turn it with a, with a lever. Uh, so I would have things that I would put in there and then I had thermometer going all the time. Um, How did you, how did you keep the air? Cause I've had those kind of circular ones and it's liquid and there's no, there wasn't a lot of, um, oxygen coming in and out. Well, mine was a big drum laying on its side. Okay. So, so you're turning it every, you're turning it a couple of times a day. So there, I never really had a moisture problem. Okay. I don't know. We also hooked up a, uh, you hooked up a blower to it as well, but I think, oh, that's the true. I forgot about that. You're right. I did. We kept going all the time in there cause we had a bunch of Aeropels, but I remember more how you would collect all the leaves and you would static compost mixed with up. I was thinking of that more. So in terms of making the compost. Yeah. A lot of the, uh, in the beginning phase, I was out in the woods getting fungal mass. Okay. And that was the source plus, I'd always thought that deciduous leaves were the foundation of all of the forest. we had over in the redmond area i mean that was it's they're the pioneering species that first come in the alders the cottonwoods the willows we don't have aspens that being the other side of the mountains so then i started looking for those leaf masses in the woods and then that's what i would use as a starter on my on my compost um i wasn't really able to find anything in the marketplace because it it's all dead i mean it's all i mean you have to think of compost companies as being trucking companies that are hauling waste being paid to haul waste material horse manure\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:37:15\n```\n it out again you know they're dirt people they really don't they're trucking people they really don't seem to know anything about soil at all especially when you start talking about what the biological values of their soil is i mean it's it's really embarrassing i've been um you know kind of uh kitchen scrap scrapping for about 20 years oh good and and but but but the challenge i have is and even in these teaming with micro chapters you know it's always the three by three by three and you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't do anything until you get that size right and so i i started um so now that i've been uh taking in this book club and stuff i started to chop my i have a salad every day i chop everything out really small right yes even the apple and everything and then i started to put compost dirt in my little compost bin in underneath my sink so like the compost i've been growing i put it in the bin under here i put it at my compost insect rice UM and i put it in under the bin then for 14 hours in a total hungry carries put compost compost in here so local dangerous was shared once i enjoyed mixture was shared so you wanted to know ou get your\u0433\u0438 st or our univerest outfits I did. they'll listen to you now i've been growing i did about 25 years of null c. had been growing obviously,urbans experimenting but they would eat those\u0446 the bin under my sink. And then I kind of like shake it up and then it starts getting warm because my, my challenge has always been as it takes, you know, it's not, it's more of a cold compost, you know, cause it's hard for me as a chip, uh, uh, you know, a kitchen scrap person to get enough to build it up and, you know, go that route. Um, I, I can take cover crops. Like I have clover on a lot of the grass, but I get excited about, you know, my scraps and, and feeding my little microbes and my friend, Harry and Fred over there in the compost pile. And so, and so I was wondering, um, if you've dealt with, cause I, I, you know, no, none of my neighbors really compost. And I think it's kind of strange and the stuff I could buy other than kisses is not to your point. It's pretty horrible stuff. Do you have any, any thoughts about, you know, the kitchen composter? No, I've always struggled with that too. Um, um, and I, I I'm just about at the point where I'm going to build a, um, uh, a worm bin. I think, in fact, I talked to Brandon about it, um, a worm bin out of his freezer that he's got there. That's not working now. Um, and then I'll be adding those into the vegetable garden and stuff. But in terms of, um, the composting, the home scraps, I don't have an answer for you. I've tried different things. Um, and I'm not ordinarily enough to it that I can systematically get everything mixed at the right proportions and everything. I'm better with a tractor. I'm better with a tractor, you know, I mean, really. Well, that sounds like more fun anyway. Yeah, I know. But I mean, it's,\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:40:28\n```\n they've got a bunch of different systems out there, but I've never had any luck with any of them. Even the one from, um, oh, we had one that had a little grinder and we tried that, but we just produced too much vegetable matter for it, for these little home cost composters, which you can put in there and it grinds it up and that sort of thing. So, yeah. Yeah. I really like those big ones, Leon, that you've got out here. The black one, because it takes a lot of time to get it it gets hot, but that big green one, that's the big barrel on the hand crank. That's my favorite kind of composter. Well, and it gets a lot of air and that's the one that I was making compost out of. Yeah. I like that a lot. Trying to, trying to figure it out. Hey, Brandon, can you please post a picture of it? I'll put one in, uh, in Patreon. Oh, that'd be awesome. Thank you. And thank you very much. There's two. Different styles out here. They're, they're both really cool. And because Leon has put so much good carbon, all these alder chips and stuff out here, we, if you turn the chips over though, we've got giant, big, fat, you know, like a fisherman's dream, big red wigglers everywhere. And so all you got to do is turn over and we never get hot out here. You know, I don't know what it was with everybody. I still don't. I don't know if we hit 70. I think we were like 67, 68. It's been cool. Yeah. And, and, but there's still just so much life in the soil. Hey, Brandon. Oh, go ahead. Sorry. I just wanted to throw in for Allison. Um, if you're not familiar with Bokashi, that's another, um, source that you can use for converting your, um, all of your scraps for your kitchen scraps. Um, you can, you can make Bokashi pretty simply, um, with elective bacillus, um, and, and molasses. Um, and basically you would wet a, a substrate, which would usually be like a cracked wheat, but you can pretty much use anything as the substrate. Um, and then what you do is dry it out. There's a process of drying, drying that substrate out. Um, and those active microbes will, will, will, will, will, will, will, will, will, will, will, will, will then be inactive until, until it's, it's wet. Um, so like you can, you can make this stuff pretty, pretty easily and cheaply. Um, and then I have a compost bucket as well. Allison's a master brewer. So yeah, just, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, yeah, she's got it. Beer Kashi. Beer Kashi over Bokashi, right? I love it. Definitely worth trying. Thank you very much. Yes. We've got a couple of questions.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:43:29\n```\n but, um, one thing I wanted to comment on was with the composting, we were, we were not composting for the purpose of breaking down organic matter from our, you know, the close of loop. We were composting specifically to try and get the highest microbial activity and diversity we could in a compost. So it was a very different purpose. Um, and with that, uh, one of the things that, we kind of figured out was that you really can't cheat time. The best compost that we ever got was static, static compost piles that would sit. Uh, and the only reason we were really using that barrel was because from WSDA, we had to achieve those thermophilic conditions. We had to heat it, show we feed it for, and keep logs to 141 degrees for three days before we could sell the material to show it was free of pathogens. But if you're not working within those regulatory conditions, you could absolutely, uh, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, you could, create a pile. I mean, my dad loves bag leaves. He's obsessed with them. I've moved more bag leaves in my lifetime because of this man. Um, I can't even tell you Brandon's gotten it. I had a sign out in front of our house for what? 15 years bag leaves wanted and people would drop them by. I do about a hundred bags of leaves in the fall. In fact, over here on the peninsula, I'm having a hard time getting leaves. I have to go to the dump. I had to bribe them with garlic to get permission to go in and remove the leaves. So anyway, yeah, the leaves are critical. We, and we haven't had any issues with, uh, pesticides or this, well, herbicides, things like that really, uh, we've noticed, of course, when we were doing this commercially, this was, you know, decades ago. Now it was a little bit less of an issue at that time. Cause we knew the leaf source from the neighbors. We knew the leaf source from the neighbors. We knew the leaf source from the neighbors. We knew the leaf source from the neighbors. So the more we, um, you know, we're collecting leaves from sources, you don't know. And then the other thing we did was we took finished compost in this case, it was only compost. And we had a 200 gallon smart pod. So a whole yard of it. And we just threw a little bit of horse manure that I knew had worms in it into that, that, uh, thing. And we just left it. We'll let the worms work through that compost for a couple of years. And that was, that was another way to do it. So, um, we other way to do it now if I were to do that again I would say I'd start rather than filling that whole smart pot with compost at the beginning I would have put just a little bit in with the horse manure made the worms work that material and then kept adding more and more compost so that they would work it more thoroughly and keep all the worms in a more concentrated mass so they'll reproduce faster that's something Tim Wilson really kind of taught us around vermicomposting but that's another way to get really microbially active compost for peas or your garden as well so I wanted to throw those things out there nice I'll go ahead and start getting some of the questions out DW sent me a question and\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:46:41\n```\n what was the inception or of the brewer like who came up with the brewer who whose idea was that what what was the idea like who who was the person that had the aha moment with the brewer it's the it's the biology I'm curious about why like why did that come into your mind why did you use that why did you select that and like what what sparked that idea I might I'm an idea guy so I'm just curious where did the idea come from the idea came from trying to figure out something that was simple because my client's client base primarily were residential homeowners on an acre or so and I wanted something really really simple so that's why the five gallon brewer the five gallon container even though it doesn't have a slope bottom that's the only problem was it and then it was a matter of how do we deliver air to it um and a compressor didn't give me enough air so then I had to go to a blower and the piping and everything was a three-quarter inch pvc pipe and then I took a hair dryer and took a straight pipe and then just slowly melted it until I had it into a coil that went around and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer and then I had to go to a hair dryer uh i think they were once 132nd there were holes that went on the bottom of this coil that were spaced one inch apart so all the air would come down from the the blower down the tube and then it would go to the circle where the holes were and that would then give us uh the circulation not only on the bottom of the container to keep it from biofilm biofilm collecting but it would also extract all the biology it was pretty violent i mean if it's bubbling pretty violently um and that's how we got all the extraction so that was what i came up with leon what did you say at the beginning of that about what was wrong with the bottom of the five gallon bucket you well if you talk to people about biofilm you try to get rid of all your 90 degree corners oh i got you i got and so i never had a problem with that but it was a potential problem gotcha um because i didn't know about biofilm or anything else before i started this process i just got really excited about the fact that all of these sites that i was on were basically\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:49:55\n```\n the plants were dying and you could drive through the development and see that and the most important thing i felt that could be done was to put beneficial biology back into that system and then get people to quit spraying because the research at the time was showing that in these developments that you have spray rigs that go through and spray chemicals on them and initially they would have a flatbed truck with a big tank but they switched over to vans so you wouldn't be noticed in the neighborhood but they would come in to these you know 50 50 different homes in a development and you'd have somebody in there once a week spraying a home well we could pick up traces of that a quarter mile away so you know that all of those houses in there are always being sprayed with all these chemicals um and it shows so i felt that gee if we can put the beneficial biology in there and spray all these chemicals back onto the plants and also into the soil and get things functioning again that would be the i don't know what the top thing i could do was to get those things functioning again does it did that answer your question pretty random oh did he go away the end of that was brilliant that was exactly what i was looking for the utility and and why you did the thing you did and i get that a lot yeah and it was the reason that we called the company kiss keep it simple because there were only two other manufacturers of brewers in this country that i know of both commercial and they had tons of parts and processes and the tea would go through a motor and all these things and i just wanted it simple and so that's there were there were seven parts to this brewer including the lid and the bucket and the blower that's awesome um i've got another question here for you leon if you if you sure want to take another one we're getting up on an hour here i don't know okay i don't want to hang in there with this but um fm is asking was it difficult to advocate advocate for organic practices versus synthetic methods in the market and was it hard to persuade farmers uh traditional landscapers and that kind of stuff about organic methods uh it was really difficult with homeowners because it was so easy during the mid-70s just to put chemicals down nobody thought there was anything wrong with it nobody thought there was anything wrong with\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:52:57\n```\n price became the the the point of of issue i mean we would try to get people to put in uh four to six inches of soil and they would not not even want to do that and here they're around their home it's all been compacted the painters come out when he built the house he's poured his chemicals around the perimeter uh you wouldn't believe all the things that we dug up sheetrock and everything else so these soils around these homes didn't have much of a chance and then what happens is they put in lots of times the wrong plants and then people to keep those plants alive they're putting down more chemicals so it's a it's a real vicious circle that i was seeing this would have been uh early 80s 1980s so allison had a question about and i don't know this is probably an open question to everybody about her creeping buttercup invasion property um does has does anybody have any experience with creeping buttercup i was i was fortunate enough to see allison's food forest and gardens and stuff this past weekend and it's really cool and um for me the creeping buttercup was just pretty but i'm sure it's a real pain in the butt so any solutions anybody for that one you you have to change the environment that's the only thing i know are you saying she should move that's my suggestion find another plant that can out compete it something that grows even quicker get some blackberry or something yeah yeah kudzu kudzu will take care of it it's tough because it it is so successful at reproducing itself i mean you start taking it out you're tearing little fig filaments and all of those come back up i would think that the only way to get rid of it is you've got to raise your soil level so what you're trying to do is above that oversaturated part which may be impossible that's right maybe too big of an area but alison do you guys get warm enough over there because you get considered it was considerably warmer over there than it is over here i'm wondering if you could do some sort of like put black tarps out do some kind of thermal and just you know you would kill off everything but then you could bring some kind of like that one i don't know what that lime green almost yellow ground cover you had that was so pretty you know if you could get something that's a pretty good one in here if you don't want to go high ground with those they'd be too picky if you weren't growing just eat one next time i'd not even do when you get it done if it's going to be a good one good one if you get up to it's a good one if you get it done if you get it done i'm not going to die i'm gonna keep it up You know, if you could get something established before it could come back, you know. Yeah, that's a good idea. Right now, I'm just, you know, doing like lasagna gardening and building up a foot above it and hoping that it doesn't creep in.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:56:12\n```\n But I think part of our problem might be that our soil is so wet where we are. I mean, parts, I would say half of our property is underwater half of the year. Oh, my gosh. It's really bacteria rich. And it's probably pretty low oxygen, too. Uh-huh. It's got that much water in it. Blueberries look so good. Low pH. Have you tried turning them into a fermented compost tea? Usually the quicker growing greens around our property are highest in minerals and nitrogen. And we end up fermenting them in the compost tea and it ends up becoming a liquid nitrogen and mineral compost. Really? Wow. I'll try that. Oh, I'm sorry. I have to go. There's a, my husband just brought home a 46 Studebaker and it's driving around the house right now. Oh, my God. How exciting. Very cool. Yeah. It's his dad's car. We're getting his dad's car. So thank you so much. I love you all. Thank you, Allison. Bye. Bye. A 46 Studebaker. That's a beautiful view. That's awesome. Yeah, it's big. A lot of metal. That's really cool. Well, does anybody, anybody else have any questions? We're getting up on an hour. Leon, I don't know if you want to go ahead and wrap it up now. Well, if anyone has any questions, any way I can be helpful. Sure. I just had one last one. I was just checking to see, Leon, do you have anyone who was like your mentor or something? That, you know, like if you could only take, you know, three books with you, you know, is there, is there a short list or something that, you know, can kind of help? Maybe we'll be inspired to make our own next version of a compost tea brewer or something. Awesome question. The. Probably looking back on the, the Japanese man, I can't remember his name. And I'm afraid to get up and go look at the book. He was phenomenal. And then there's another one, 2000. No. You're talking about, you're talking about One Star Revolution by Masanobu Fukuoka, I think. Yeah, I can never pronounce it. That would be one. And probably the other one would be Farmers of 40 Centuries. It was published, I think, in 1903 and by, I think, E.C. White, and he traveled all through Asia and documented the farming techniques. And it's a fascinating book because they hadn't lost any productivity and they had 4,000 years they'd farmed this land.\n\n\n```timestamp\n00:59:20\n```\n You see the plow come in and commercial ag and everything, and now we're losing acreage. We're not maintaining that same fertility. So that was a really important book for me. And then there's one other one is what do you do with an idea? If you ever get a chance to read that one, that's a fun one. And it's. What got you into bio chart ads? What? What book got you? What got you into bio chart? Or was it Paul Taylor? I think it was. I think what got me into bio chart was. Building a one yard. Kiln. That Paul Taylor designed and he's Contiki kiln. And he was an astro scientist that then decided bio chart. That was the answer and dedicated all of his time and energy into building, designing and building the Contiki kiln. And that was the reason that I built it, which I still have. But it was just an efficient way to make bio chart. Okay. I wasn't sure if it was a book or there was something else I could, I didn't really know. I, what got you into bio chart originally? Well, it was, it's pure carbon. It only makes sense. I mean, when, when you look at what happened in South America, off the Amazon where they were able, and then there's other places they've discovered around the world too. It was a bio chart, but the natives were able to figure out how to capture nutrients that were coming into the soil from trees and leaves and other things. And then leave it in the root zone for their vegetables and other plants. So that's brilliant. I mean, that should be in all the equations for anyone who's a soil that they're trying to build up activate the bio chart. First, we used Alaska fish and I, and I think if you're, if you're adding that in, it's just such a great bonus. Cause. Not only water retention and the biology for the microbes, but it holds all those nutrients for you for the plants to use. I remember, yeah. Before you got, you got sick or you were dealing some with health stuff. You were talking to the forestry department in Oregon about setting up some kilns. So when, when they did like slash and burn, if they burned within the. kilns they could create a byproduct that could either put carbon back into the forest or could\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:02:26\n```\n on right and you were also trying to get back to china to try and because it's a very simple technology with biochar that they could potentially use to burn bamboo or whatever parent material to create to improve the soils over there because i think you came back and said the soils are all really really poor well the soils were tragic um and and a lot of it was because when ma was in charge he um wanted to out compete steel production with england in the u.s and so all of the everybody was supposed to um melt down all of their metal and that's even kitchenware i mean you everything and so they all had all these little uh kilns going in people's backyards literally and all of those chemicals got spread all over everything all the farmland everywhere it was horrible um yeah they have a lot of heavy heavy chemical use in china that's why we were went over uh to do two things one was to start the production of the 500 gallon brewers that we would ship to the u.s and i had a manufacturer for that because i was also on a committee national committee that was setting up the standards for biochar use nationally with each state and then at that point um trump had come into the picture and people were nervous and were bringing home their um lab results their documentations because they thought a lot of it was going to disappear and for what reason i don't know totally off topic but allison just texted me a picture of that studebaker oh i bet it's gorgeous i'll show it to you amazing beautiful i'll post patreon yeah good for her good for her well hey um we should probably wrap it up it's been about an hour i don't want to okay overstep what we're asking of you and um thank you so much for coming on i think everybody had fun that was great well and and the man who uh had the question about the the catalyst for designing the five gallon brewer he should really buy the book what do you do with an idea because it's very inspiring and it's inspiring it's simplistic in that it's real similar to uh the giving tree if you're familiar with that um but it's the absolute process that i go through\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:05:34\n```\n dan uh wainwright evans the bug lady i know you sent a copy to her so i did yes yeah i read it because you sent it to her yeah it's a good book it's a nice little push that allows someone who is is creative to uh push through all of the um criticisms and other people that other people have and the failures you have along the way but let me tell you when you when you're actually successful lots of things and lots of people will come to you with that yeah that you normally wouldn't meet i mean it's it's it's fun yeah maybe uh one thing maybe there's something to end on dad why don't you share your uh monrovia experience with um the story you always like to tell about the sales guy when we can end on that on that story okay we we were back in uh philadelphia uh huge trade show huge trade show egg show uh i was on a corner with monrovia and they had five five booths or whatever five areas condensed into one so they had a big big area i think there were five sales five four or five salesmen on floor and i was there with my five gallon brewer and they're and and the salesmen had all been giving me a bad time because i'm not a very good salesman i just want to explain the process and that's what i'm excited about and they said oh leon this guy's coming he's going to be a lot of fun for you and it was a man that was probably about five foot tall and he had two men one on each side that were probably 350 pounds they look like big bouncers and um he came up and he said okay tell me about this control she broke thing and i said well you know this is what it does and this is what you do and on and on he says no you don't get it you have 15 seconds to tell me what it solves what it costs and when you can deliver and quite frankly you're out of time and he walked off so so later on i wrote an article for a magazine on he was actually asking all the right questions i just sort of got caught up in the wrong thing so that's really what people want to know what does it solve what does it cost when can you deliver and he was the number one salesman out of the philadelphia area in terms of moving product but and so i sent him a\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:08:48\n```\n nobody had ever written about it before yeah i mean roby is huge huge plant supply company for those of you that aren't familiar they they provide all the plants that you see at all the nurseries that you go to most likely they're they're really big and uh that was the big challenge with compost eat because it's such a complicated thing and it's you know the cost of entry is relatively high you know buying a brewer at the time was 100 140 dollars um you know it was a lot of some it was a big ask for someone to try technology and and understand it and and you really couldn't explain it rapidly so it was really people like jeff and elaine that were out there uh teaching classes writing books and articles that really created any demand whatsoever for the product or for compost tea so really grateful for that and if we had stayed just a compost tea business we would no longer be in business sadly because there just hasn't been enough interest in it and had to find other things things to do well it had um the variable on the compost and then people not following directions i mean there's just too many variables and ways that people can screw it up and not be have successes um so education is a big piece and that's why it's really a ground movement of and i see it on youtube people using it but a lot of the the youtubes that i have seen on compost tea are not accurate from what i learned so they're not talking about water quality or all the pieces that you can screw up if you're not paying attention to and the people aren't doing what stations that they're not doing and so that's why it's so hard to figure that out in just as a way of showing them how we're doing it and you're right and you're right and you're right but when you put all that stuff in you you you really you you just you know you don't have to take a deep look at a plan and just go ahead and put it in your head and just yeah and i think that's really it's really really important um and yeah and we can do that in the future as well just to remind people that what we're doing is really important and you know i mean i i you know we've been doing this for a long time like 25 years i think we've been doing this for a long time like 25 years this year and i think that's really important you know let's just be a little bit more careful with what we're buying let's just say you know let's just kind of as some of the new stuff we've been learning at KISS over the last couple months so yeah I'll be I'll be in week nine next one so I'll be getting ready to harvest so I'll have some stuff to show boy your plant material just looks great thank you you can call it cannabis in here dad it's okay you what you can call it cannabis in here it's okay yeah um well it was such a contrast from the the casino we went to oh well I think those guys might even be in here yeah it is very different growing in uh different uh environments for sure yeah yeah and outdoors is just you know\n\n\n```timestamp\n01:11:59\n```\n right well we'll see I think yeah yeah they shouldn't they shouldn't be there in september they should be harvested yes I'm I'm uh I'm running behind on males so I I'm pushing as hard as I can right now god yeah they're gonna have some work to do yeah yeah I'm gonna go through and clean that whole spot out though I have to it's it's it's about to touch the top of that hoop house it's pretty crazy well and you've you've pruned them how many times this will be the third time that I've pruned them so yeah and they're and they're what four feet across yeah yeah they're probably three to four feet across yeah yeah they look great thanks so all right well thanks guys yeah next time okay thanks everybody everybody take care have a wonderful fourth of july yeah be safe yeah yeah come back with all your digits yeah really bye-bye bye thank you", "id": "53d80036-ac66-4921-871b-ada1dcddcedc"}

Clarifying these misconceptions through scientific explanations helps cultivate a more informed approach to cannabis growing, leading to improved practices based on evidence rather than anecdote.\n\n- \"Another thing, when I was talking to him about all those mythologies, I'd kept trying to bring up is like with the, with the praying leaf thing, you know, um, nobody, nobody knows definitively because we can't replicate it.\"\n\nThe conversation revealed a critical view on how cannabis cultivation myths can propagate through communities without substantial scientific evidence to support them. By discussing the biological and environmental factors affecting plant behaviors such as leaf praying, the participants emphasized the importance of rigorous testing and observation to distinguish between myth and reality in cultivation practices.\n\n- \"So that's the that's the takeaway, I think, is just to apply critical thinking and find, you know, find a an excuse that seems plausible and then research it, you know.\"\n\nThis dialogue encourages a shift from anecdotal evidence to a more scientifically grounded approach in understanding and applying cultivation techniques.

This provides additional nutrients for the Trichoderma to grow.\n\t\tWatering:\n\t\t\tMoisten the compost with dechlorinated water. It should be damp but not waterlogged.\n\t\t\tEnsure the compost remains moist throughout the growing period.\n\t\tEnvironment:\n\t\t\tKeep the container in a warm, shaded area.

This can be done by adding a layer of the compost to your garden bed or mixing it into potting soil for potted plants. Direct Application: For established plants, you can gently work the compost into the soil around the base of the plants. Compost Tea: Alternatively, you can make a compost tea by mixing the Trichoderma-enriched compost with dechlorinated water and allowing it to steep for 24-48 hours. Use this tea to water your plants or spray it on the leaves.\n\t\tOngoing Maintenance: \n\t\t\tContinue to monitor the moisture levels and overall health of your plants. Reapply the Trichoderma-enriched compost or compost tea as needed, typically every few weeks, to maintain a healthy population of beneficial fungi in your soil.", "id": "4804324e-c6ce-46f3-b2b8-689acee20d6f"}

Most gardeners don't give compost much thought. They make or buy it and they apply it. It's all the same. There is more than one kind of compost, however, which is something that amazes many veteran compost makers. We too thought that all compost, no matter what went into it, had the same biology and pH in the end. But surely upon reflection, and especially after you know something about the soil food web organisms that make up compost, the idea that the end product is always the same doesn't make any sense. As with almost every other system, what goes into it does have something to do with what comes out at the end. The fact of the matter is that by using just a bit of soil-food-web science, you can make either compost that is dominated by fungi or compost that is dominated by bacteria. It all depends on what you put into the compost pile or bin to start. And because some plants prefer their nitrogen in ammonium form and some in nitrate form, see rules 2 and 3, making compost that fosters the production of one of these forms of nitrogen over the other makes real sense.", "id": "2e35dbed-6aa1-485a-a5e5-befe5afb13e0"}

It was only in the last century that compost took a backseat to chemicals when it came to growing things. Before that, if you worked on a farm or in a garden, you routinely used compost and manure to increase fertility. This all changed when internal combustion engines replaced the horse and fewer and fewer homes, particularly in urban settings, featured chickens, cows, pigs, and other livestock. Agriculture and horticulture required chemicals because there was a dearth of manures and thus compost.", "id": "49e1c0f8-8e19-4c4d-bc30-684866081e20"}

Composting conserves valuable landfill space by recycling at least some of our household wastes. Dozens of compost bins are commercially available and a light number of books can tell you how to make compost in myriad ways. At the heart of every composting system, however, are the soil microorganisms, the members of the compost's food web. They are the ones that make compost no matter what method is employed. Their metabolic activity creates the heat and byproducts that make the composting process work. This is a chapter, not a book, on composting. What we will describe here is just a bit of the science behind composting and a few basic procedures for making compost at home. Once you have made a few batches, you can experiment and create a system that best fits your plants needs and your climate, space availability and even spousal demands.", "id": "dde7c08d-39fe-47f9-87bd-4589e21fc45c"}

All are mixed into the proper ratio. Organic materials are easy to come by. Grass clippings, autumn leaves, wood chips, straw, sawdust, branches, and virtually all kitchen scraps except meats and fats. Human and pet feces should not be composted because of the possibility that disease organisms might survive even the high heat of the compost process.

Soil depth is 6\" = 6/36 \" per yard ~= 0.1667 yds. and there are 4840 square yards in an acre.\n\n**Area in acres (0.274 cu yds/0.1667 yds )* (1/4840) = 0.00034 acres**\n\nBone meal required = P2O5 required / % Phosphate in Bone meal\n\nBone meal required = 200/0.2 = 1000\n\n**Amt. Bone meal = 1000 * 0.00034 acre = 0.34 lbs of bone meal is needed to raise the amount of Phosphate to 1,500 lbs/acre.**\n\n**Q: What about the Calcium in the Bone meal?**\nBone meal also has around 20% Ca.

The transformation of phosphate into a plant-absorbable form of phosphorus is done by phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, like those found in products like Mammoth .  These soil microbes play a pivotal role in this process by releasing enzymes that break down the P2O5 compound, freeing phosphorus for plant uptake.\n\nExtra reserves of Phosphorous (P) are essential because the amount of phosphorous that plants can actually absorb is often much less than what is present in the soil as phosphate.\n\n**M3 Value: 1299 lbs/acre:** \n\n To convert to ppm, we assume  a soil based (e.g.: has alot of dirt, much heavier than living/potting soil we use) media:\n```\n# lbs -> ppm (assumes a furrow slice that weighs 2M lbs.)\n1299 lbs/ acre * 0.5 = 649.5\n# P2O5 -> P\n649.5 * 0.44 = 283.44 ppm # Phosphate is only 44% Phosphorous\n```\n\n--> So we have a reserve of 283.44 ppm of Phosphorous locked up within Phosphate molecules. To unlock, we use something like Mammoth P to introduce microbes that specializing in breaking up the Phosphate modules.", "id": "4d5c50ef-a9df-418a-ad0e-2e056949b640"}

I had flushed the (potting) soil prior to sending samples to Logan Labs for testing.  The reason post flush that you see your pH change is  anytime any of your cations get displaced, hydrogen takes that place. And so your pH drops. The flushing removed sodium and other cations, replacing with hydrogen - so the pH goes down.\n- The Organic Matter Percent (in this case >20) just tells me this is not in-situ soil, rather a potting soil mix.\n- Sulfur AT 373 ppm: Don't have a target, so I skip it.  Actionable data for Sulfur is in the Saturated Paste test.\n- For the most part, there isn't a reason to go back to historical data, just use the here and now results - unless a deficiency (in the example Magnesium) is consistent across runs.\n- Phosphate is at 1582.  This is right at my target of 1,500.\n- Calcium is 5832 lbs/acre.  Target value for Calcium lbs/acre is 4,000.\n- Magnesium is 311 lbs/acre. Target value for Magnesium is 350 lbs/acre.\n- Potassium is 242 lbs/acre. Target value for Potassium is 600 lbs/acre.  This seems high, but cannabis uses more. Besides, we are not eating Cannabis, but smoking it.\n- Sodium is at 47 lbs/acre.  That is great.  Anything under 200, if you're at 200 and everything else looks pretty good, I'll tell people to run it. Because I want to save you money. I don't want you to flush. If you're at 200, go ahead and do the run. Flush at the end and retest.\n- The base saturation numbers are important.  As Brandan has said, the Saturated Paste report has the actionable data, but the M3 is where Brandon looks for 60% to 70% calcium, 12% to 15% magnesium. \n- \t- The Cations on the mehlic-3 test:\n\t\t- Calcium (60-70%) : 56.92\n\t\t- Magnesium (10-20%): 5.06\n\t\t- Potassium (2-5%): 2.42\n\t\t- Sodium (.5 to 3%): .4\n- Brandon will typically recommend low levels of magnesium amendment because magnesium deficits are easy to detect.   And it's so easy to fix. Just two tablespoons of Epsom salt as a drench. Boom, the magnesium deficit is gone.  Magnesium is the bully cation. It will out-compete calcium and potassium.  In theory, calcium should dislodge everything. In practice, magnesium is the one that causes all the problems. So one thing you could do is you could do is a flush with gypsum. Because it will displace magnesium and potassium and sodium. So if you've got really high sodium, you might want to add a little bit of gypsum. \n- The exchangeable hydrogen is just a reverse of the log that gets you to your pH. So I just tell people to ignore that one.\n- Brandon doesn't look too hard at trace elements, boron, iron, manganese, and aluminum. I look at iron (in this report the iron on the saturated paste was 171 ppm) and aluminum (93 ppm), not even looking to see really what the number is, but just to see if one of them is really high and one of them is not really high, then I'm going to have a concern about either iron or aluminum. Let's say your iron was 300 and your aluminum's at 30. Then that gives me confidence that your iron's way too high and we need to address that. If I see them both high, both iron and aluminum high, most of our substrate is made up of iron and aluminum.   Brandon was seeing weird anomalies so he talked with Susan at Logan. Susan noted it's an iron aluminum lattice that forms most of our substrate. And they use filter papers when they're setting up the testing. If a little piece of that substrate gets sucked around the filter paper, you'll see aluminum and iron both really high.  If you see that, don't worry about it.  if iron or aluminum - one is high and one is lower, then we want to investigate. If they're 171 and 93, I wouldn't flinch about either. on the mehlic-3, the only ones that I really look at are copper (on this test it was < 0.02) and zinc (< 0.02). I'm looking for copper somewhere around 5. I'm looking for zinc around 10.\n- If your pH at 5.5 and you had excessive zinc or copper, you're in trouble. It's going to flood the plant. At 5.5, you're going to flood your plant with copper. And so Brandon always goes back to that Bruce Bugbee Utah State testing where they were doing the hydro versus the organics with the copper to see if they can get systemic benefit against fungal pathogen, they were running like 900, 9,000, Brandon can't remember the number, but some really crazy high copper concentration. All the hydro plants were crispy, necrotic, and dead. All the organic plants, the organic matter was holding on to it. And we run at a much higher pH.\n- The pH in these reports is 5.5 - way too low. Cannabis should be at 6.8 to 7.0.  When I flushed the potting soil, I washed away the cations which get replaced with Hydrogen.  Hence, the pH goes down. To raise the pH to 6.8 to 7.0: Add either 2 cups per yard of wollastonite or 1 cup per yard of aglime.  Brandon would go with the aglime just because you're low and you want to get this up fast. 5.5 is really low. Now, with that said, your pH is going to naturally come up with some of our amendments. So you could probably get away with the wollastonite. But if it was me, I'd probably go with the 1 cup of agline just to get my pH up fast. \n- And then the last section of the Mehlic 3 - \"Other\", have numbers for Ammonium and nitrate.  Ammonium and nitrate are your two forms of nitrogen in your soil. Some plants prefer one or the other. Cannabis does great with nitrates. When Brandon looks at the Ammonium number, if it is 0.9 or lower, he is great with it.  Experientially, we know that under 1, we're not having ammonium cycling into nitrate. This means the temperature in the soil is going to be stable. The roots are not going to get burnt.  Brandon just saw somebody that had all their ammonium numbers  above 11, like 11, 16.  They are going to get a ton of nitrate from that!  We see high ammonium anytime somebody adds compost, worm cast that's not finished, or somebody floods their beds. And that's just part of the chemistry of how the cycling happens.  If you go anaerobic in a bed, the nitrates will show up as ammonium. And that's why you get that stinky ammonia smell. It's actually your nitrate leaving your pocket, your dollars are leaving your bed. \n- Back to Phosphate.  The Phosphate number of 1582 lbs/acre  is sufficiency right on the dot. The target Phosphate number is  1500. Where nitrate, you have nothing. It all got washed out when you did the flush. And so it shows you how mobile sodium and nitrates are. They both went down a lot. \n- The nitrate number is 1 ppm.  Logan Labs makes it easy for us to figure out how many lbs/acre this is.  Given what we assume about a  [[soil science notes#Furrow Slice]] , where the soil ways 2M lbs, 1 ppm of Nitrate = 2 lbs/acre.  Very little Nitrate.  The Nitrate was flushed out of the soil.  Nitrates work with sulfur to provide all the amino acids and  proteins. \n- When Brandon sees nitrate really low and Phosphate at 1582, He is really tempted to bump that phosphorus reserve up. While not as environmentally responsible. However, Brandon is fine with it because the phosphorus is not gonna go anywhere. One, we don't have runoff. Phosphorus doesn't off gas like nitrate does. Phosphorus with no runoff and organic forms that are slow to cycle, it's not going anywhere.  If we added seven cups of fish bone meal and five cups of calphos, the phosphate's going to be well over 2300 for the next round. But then you are not going to have to add any phosphate for like three rounds maybe.  **Seven cups of fish bone will bring in 96 pounds of nitrate.????**\n- ( I am confused by the 96 pounds of Nitrate)..but...Brandon starts out figuring how much Nitrate needed to be added by starting at 200 as the target,  He then subtracts the amount of Nitrate in the fish bone meal (which he calculated to be 96 lbs, and I don't understand how that happens) 200lbs/acre Nitrate target - 96 lbs/acre -2 lbs/acre left in the soil = 102 lbs/acre deficit that can be filled with different nitrate inputs.\n- Brandon's three favorite Nitrogen additives include alfalfa, soybean, and feather meal.  Any input that you get is going to have its fines (In soil science, \"fines\" refer to the fine particles in soil, like silt and clay) . So there's a fast little flush of nitrate from feather meal because of the fines, but then it slowly breaks down, trickles out through the rest of the round. And so something like blood meal, it's going to be super fast, very available. You're going to burn through all of it in the first month. Brandon likes to do multiple inputs for different release rates when a larger amount of Nitrogen is needed.", "id": "744b21b3-ef21-4565-9725-0cafe4a08f38"}

Brandon's target for soluble salts is around 1,000 to 1,200. Something that Brandon has noticed from looking at thousands of reports is that this number really is just reflective of your calcium, magnesium, potassium, and chlorides. It should be more, it should give us a better picture of nitrate as well.  But Brandon used to think nitrates were  also reflected in the Soluble Salts number.  This doesn't seem to be the case, because he'll see really low numbers with really high nitrates and ammonium. And so when Brandon looks at the Soluble Salts number,  he uses it mainly as a guesstimate as to how he is going to balance the cations. The number on the Saturated Paste test (425 lbs/acre ) tells us without even looking at your calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium that they're gonna be low. And sure enough, they are.  Once the Soluble Salt number gets above 1,200,  the plant could grow well, but we're going past sufficiency. When the Soluble Salt level exceeds the sufficiency number of around 1,200, plants experience increased osmotic stress\n- Chloride at 52 ppm is great!  200-300 is in the very high range.  The sodium and chloride metrics are very low.  Four or five rounds of growing should be possible without thinking about flushing.\n- Everybody's trace elements are low. I don't worry about it because if the chlorides aren't high, it doesn't block and you don't have issues. As long as you're not over watering or having chlorides, trace elements are rarely gonna be the limiting factor.  Brandon does not like to increase the trace elements because low amounts do not block the health of the plant and too much trace elements (e.g.: Boron) could mean throwing out the soil.\n- Bicarbonates at 34 ppm.  That's fantastic.  Brandon  noted maybe one in a thousand tests, he'll see a bicarbonate issue. If the Bicarbonates number is anything under 120, I wouldn't even worry about. If the number is too high, it's going to be reflecting in the pH and other readings will be off because of the hard water.\n- Sulfur at 37.82 ppm  is low.  I like to target a reading of 68.  Adding elemental Sulfur to adjust the Sulfur level is a mistake in this situation since the pH is 5.5. Elemental Sulfur is great at lowering the pH.  Which is exactly what we do not need.  Since the Soluble Salts number is low, the Cations (CA, MG, K) when these are fixed will bring in the Sulfates that will raise the amount of Sulfur.\n- The Phosphorus number is at 0.77 ppm.  Although higher than many, 0.77  is below the target of 2.4 (which 97% of the growers are below this target). That tells me that at the minimum sufficiency of 1500 lbs/acre of Phosphate, you're getting 0.77 available. So there's two things we could do. We can bump up the  reserve, which we're gonna do.  And/or we could add microbial mass, like the Mammoth P product  once a week. Brandon has some growers that have phosphorus (as Phosphate) reserves above 3000. They're running microbial mass or something like that once a month. They are getting readings far greater than 2.4 ppm - around 6 ppm because their reserve is so high.\n- The cations: let's do calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium.", "id": "30a4cfe8-07b9-4e08-8ece-e35b2d3d81ee"}

That goes back to magnesium in practice and actual field practice. Magnesium runs the cations. It will out-compete potassium. Potassium is much more important in Cannabis than it is for nutrient-dense food. Too much Magnesium will prevent your potassium from getting into the plant. So my targets this is just between you and me, calcium 200, magnesium 38, and potassium 125.  And that's why I ask people to do that second application of potassium sulfate.

But the normal way to correct high Magnesium, let's say your magnesium's 52 and your calcium's 104, you simply divide 52 by the target, 38, and that gives me a factor of 1.37.

We have 12.63 in the soil.  This makes for a deficit of 38 - 12.63 ~= 25 ppm. There's two ways you could approach this. You could add 1.1 cups of magnesium sulfate, or you could do nothing and wait and see if you get a magnesium deficiency.  A lot of times Tad, when he's doing recommendations, he'll skip over magnesium as long as it's in deficit and just tell them not to do anything unless they see a problem. And that's a safe way to handle it. What Brandon typically does is bump down the amount to amend to 1/2 of the deficit. In this case 0.75 cups of magnesium sulfate.  Most growers go in with a heavy hand. Even if they fall short, it's so easy to fix that with the magnesium drench. The plants will respond in 24 to 48 hours.  I want to make sure that you've got enough to get going.  Magnesium is the central element in the chlorophyll molecule. So it is very important to be in the soil.\n\nGetting a cup or less of magnesium sulfate spread out evenly over a bed is going to be really hard. You're going to have dead spots and hot spots.

I prefer the target range of 6.8 to 6.9 for optimal nutrient release rates and reduced\u00a0heavy metal uptake.\u00a0 Continue to pH your irrigation events to 6.8-7.0 with a heavy metals safe pH down product. I prefer citric acid. You're\u00a0too close to perfect to make any adjustments here. Great job! You will have an excellent round at 7.0.\n- Organic matter percentage is not an accurate metric for\u00a0potting soils, ignore.\u00a0\n- 2160 lbs/acra of P2O5\u00a0is a touch above my target of 1500, but excellent. Phosphorus is hard to get into solution so a really big reserve is required to provide available P to your plants. It is really hard to have too much P. No action, this is great!\u00a0\n- Cations look a touch off but we will look at the Paste Report for actionable metrics. I place much more weight on the available cations shown on your Paste Report.\u00a0\n-\t- The Cations on the mehlic-3 test:\n\t\t- Calcium (60-70%) : 81.28\n\t\t- Magnesium (10-20%): 9.48\n\t\t- Potassium (2-5%): 3.57\n\t\t- Sodium (.5 to 3%): 1.26\n- Sodium is good but creeping up at\u00a090 lbs/acre. I ask folks to flush anytime they hit 200 so you should be able to get several more rounds without a flush. Luckily sodium is easy to flush. If sodium gets too high it causes osmotic stress and can outcompete productive cations, especially potassium. Once you approach 200 ppm we will want to set up a plan to flush. Flush 10% by volume. Be sure to get the soil to field capacity and use a surfactant to improve the efficacy of the flush. You will want to capture 10% by volume meaning if you have a 4'x4' with 100 gallons you will need to capture 10 gallons. Be sure to add some trichoderma (Rootshield) or some Lactobacillus at the end of your flush to prevent fungal pathogens from taking a foothold. If you choose to run this without a flush be on the lookout for cation deficiencies and symptoms of osmotic stress. No action at this time.\n- Exchangeable\u00a0hydrogen is just another way\u00a0to look at PH, you can ignore.\n- Your trace elements look a bit off (Cu 1.17 ppm and Zn 3.33 ppm) but be careful chasing a \"perfect\" trace element metric. There is almost always plenty of trace available through contamination from water or compost. Trace elements, while essential, are not composed into the plant and can be used over and over again so very little is needed. The margin for error between a perfect metric and dead plants and ruined soil is hard to achieve in a field\u00a0with an enormous buffer so it is dangerous territory in raised beds or pots. Proceed with caution. It is my opinion that these should be left alone unless a specific deficiency tied to one of the trace elements shows visually.\u00a0\n- Ammonium at 0.2 ppm is great. I normally\u00a0look for a metric of 0.9 or lower. This soil is temperature stable. You should not get any additional nitrate release from this either. No action.\n-  anytime Nitrate drops below 30 ppm all growth stops but I get equally concerned anytime a test goes over 200 for an indoor run.\u00a0 Do not over apply. Excess nitrate at harvest diminishes terpenes, reduces yield and delays senescence.\u00a0 It is always a best practice to add as many nitrate inputs as possible for optimal release rates. You will have a small gap to fill.\n-\n- **2.4 * 0.274 = .66 of a cup** cups of neem\n- **3 * 0.274 = .822** cups of crab and\u00a0\n- **3 * 0.274 = .822** cups of blood meal per yard", "id": "3b8afdf8-2bd9-437f-be06-3f1f45591d85"}

Optimally, this should be between 1,000 - 1,200.  Note: research additional info as well as say why this number is important.\n- Chloride = 223 ppm.  This sounds high? Research.\n- Bicarbonates = 45 ppm. Research, report, say why.\n- Sulfur(s) = 295 ppm.  You will need to research the documents to determine what is the target value for Sulfur.,  Also include why sulfur is important.\n- Phosphorous = 0.41 ppm.  Same as with Sulfur - research what level it should be and say why it is important.\n- Percent Cation\n\t- Calcium: 78\n\t- Magnesium: 9.83\n\t- Potassium: 10.01\n\t- Sodium: 2.17\nThe ratio between the cations is super important. Research why, what it should be, and then compare/contrast what we have here.  For example, I think Calcium is too high.\n- TBD: Unclear about what the trace elements tell us.

Soil depth is 6\" = 6/36 \" per yard ~= 0.1667 yds. and there are 4840 square yards in an acre.\n\n**Area in acres (0.274 cu yds/0.1667 yds )* (1/4840) = 0.00034 acres**\n\nBone meal required = P2O5 required / % Phosphate in Bone meal\n\nBone meal required = 200/0.2 = 1000\n\n**Amt. Bone meal = 1000 * 0.00034 acre = 0.34 lbs of bone meal is needed to raise the amount of Phosphate to 1,500 lbs/acre.**\n\n**Q: What about the Calcium in the Bone meal?**\nBone meal also has around 20% Ca.

The transformation of phosphate into a plant-absorbable form of phosphorus is done by phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, like those found in products like Mammoth .  These soil microbes play a pivotal role in this process by releasing enzymes that break down the P2O5 compound, freeing phosphorus for plant uptake.\n\nExtra reserves of Phosphorous (P) are essential because the amount of phosphorous that plants can actually absorb is often much less than what is present in the soil as phosphate.\n\n**M3 Value: 1299 lbs/acre:** \n\n To convert to ppm, we assume  a soil based (e.g.: has alot of dirt, much heavier than living/potting soil we use) media:\n```\n# lbs -> ppm (assumes a furrow slice that weighs 2M lbs.)\n1299 lbs/ acre * 0.5 = 649.5\n# P2O5 -> P\n649.5 * 0.44 = 283.44 ppm # Phosphate is only 44% Phosphorous\n```\n\n--> So we have a reserve of 283.44 ppm of Phosphorous locked up within Phosphate molecules. To unlock, we use something like Mammoth P to introduce microbes that specializing in breaking up the Phosphate modules.", "id": "bef2cefd-6198-4580-ad40-31e46ac08c5d"}

I had flushed the (potting) soil prior to sending samples to Logan Labs for testing.  The reason post flush that you see your pH change is  anytime any of your cations get displaced, hydrogen takes that place. And so your pH drops. The flushing removed sodium and other cations, replacing with hydrogen - so the pH goes down.\n- The Organic Matter Percent (in this case >20) just tells me this is not in-situ soil, rather a potting soil mix.\n- Sulfur AT 373 ppm: Don't have a target, so I skip it.  Actionable data for Sulfur is in the Saturated Paste test.\n- For the most part, there isn't a reason to go back to historical data, just use the here and now results - unless a deficiency (in the example Magnesium) is consistent across runs.\n- Phosphate is at 1582.  This is right at my target of 1,500.\n- Calcium is 5832 lbs/acre.  Target value for Calcium lbs/acre is 4,000.\n- Magnesium is 311 lbs/acre. Target value for Magnesium is 350 lbs/acre.\n- Potassium is 242 lbs/acre. Target value for Potassium is 600 lbs/acre.  This seems high, but cannabis uses more. Besides, we are not eating Cannabis, but smoking it.\n- Sodium is at 47 lbs/acre.  That is great.  Anything under 200, if you're at 200 and everything else looks pretty good, I'll tell people to run it. Because I want to save you money. I don't want you to flush. If you're at 200, go ahead and do the run. Flush at the end and retest.\n- The base saturation numbers are important.  As Brandan has said, the Saturated Paste report has the actionable data, but the M3 is where Brandon looks for 60% to 70% calcium, 12% to 15% magnesium. \n- \t- The Cations on the mehlic-3 test:\n\t\t- Calcium (60-70%) : 56.92\n\t\t- Magnesium (10-20%): 5.06\n\t\t- Potassium (2-5%): 2.42\n\t\t- Sodium (.5 to 3%): .4\n- Brandon will typically recommend low levels of magnesium amendment because magnesium deficits are easy to detect.   And it's so easy to fix. Just two tablespoons of Epsom salt as a drench. Boom, the magnesium deficit is gone.  Magnesium is the bully cation. It will out-compete calcium and potassium.  In theory, calcium should dislodge everything. In practice, magnesium is the one that causes all the problems. So one thing you could do is you could do is a flush with gypsum. Because it will displace magnesium and potassium and sodium. So if you've got really high sodium, you might want to add a little bit of gypsum. \n- The exchangeable hydrogen is just a reverse of the log that gets you to your pH. So I just tell people to ignore that one.\n- Brandon doesn't look too hard at trace elements, boron, iron, manganese, and aluminum. I look at iron (in this report the iron on the saturated paste was 171 ppm) and aluminum (93 ppm), not even looking to see really what the number is, but just to see if one of them is really high and one of them is not really high, then I'm going to have a concern about either iron or aluminum. Let's say your iron was 300 and your aluminum's at 30. Then that gives me confidence that your iron's way too high and we need to address that. If I see them both high, both iron and aluminum high, most of our substrate is made up of iron and aluminum.   Brandon was seeing weird anomalies so he talked with Susan at Logan. Susan noted it's an iron aluminum lattice that forms most of our substrate. And they use filter papers when they're setting up the testing. If a little piece of that substrate gets sucked around the filter paper, you'll see aluminum and iron both really high.  If you see that, don't worry about it.  if iron or aluminum - one is high and one is lower, then we want to investigate. If they're 171 and 93, I wouldn't flinch about either. on the mehlic-3, the only ones that I really look at are copper (on this test it was < 0.02) and zinc (< 0.02). I'm looking for copper somewhere around 5. I'm looking for zinc around 10.\n- If your pH at 5.5 and you had excessive zinc or copper, you're in trouble. It's going to flood the plant. At 5.5, you're going to flood your plant with copper. And so Brandon always goes back to that Bruce Bugbee Utah State testing where they were doing the hydro versus the organics with the copper to see if they can get systemic benefit against fungal pathogen, they were running like 900, 9,000, Brandon can't remember the number, but some really crazy high copper concentration. All the hydro plants were crispy, necrotic, and dead. All the organic plants, the organic matter was holding on to it. And we run at a much higher pH.\n- The pH in these reports is 5.5 - way too low. Cannabis should be at 6.8 to 7.0.  When I flushed the potting soil, I washed away the cations which get replaced with Hydrogen.  Hence, the pH goes down. To raise the pH to 6.8 to 7.0: Add either 2 cups per yard of wollastonite or 1 cup per yard of aglime.  Brandon would go with the aglime just because you're low and you want to get this up fast. 5.5 is really low. Now, with that said, your pH is going to naturally come up with some of our amendments. So you could probably get away with the wollastonite. But if it was me, I'd probably go with the 1 cup of agline just to get my pH up fast. \n- And then the last section of the Mehlic 3 - \"Other\", have numbers for Ammonium and nitrate.  Ammonium and nitrate are your two forms of nitrogen in your soil. Some plants prefer one or the other. Cannabis does great with nitrates. When Brandon looks at the Ammonium number, if it is 0.9 or lower, he is great with it.  Experientially, we know that under 1, we're not having ammonium cycling into nitrate. This means the temperature in the soil is going to be stable. The roots are not going to get burnt.  Brandon just saw somebody that had all their ammonium numbers  above 11, like 11, 16.  They are going to get a ton of nitrate from that!  We see high ammonium anytime somebody adds compost, worm cast that's not finished, or somebody floods their beds. And that's just part of the chemistry of how the cycling happens.  If you go anaerobic in a bed, the nitrates will show up as ammonium. And that's why you get that stinky ammonia smell. It's actually your nitrate leaving your pocket, your dollars are leaving your bed. \n- Back to Phosphate.  The Phosphate number of 1582 lbs/acre  is sufficiency right on the dot. The target Phosphate number is  1500. Where nitrate, you have nothing. It all got washed out when you did the flush. And so it shows you how mobile sodium and nitrates are. They both went down a lot. \n- The nitrate number is 1 ppm.  Logan Labs makes it easy for us to figure out how many lbs/acre this is.  Given what we assume about a  [[soil science notes#Furrow Slice]] , where the soil ways 2M lbs, 1 ppm of Nitrate = 2 lbs/acre.  Very little Nitrate.  The Nitrate was flushed out of the soil.  Nitrates work with sulfur to provide all the amino acids and  proteins. \n- When Brandon sees nitrate really low and Phosphate at 1582, He is really tempted to bump that phosphorus reserve up. While not as environmentally responsible. However, Brandon is fine with it because the phosphorus is not gonna go anywhere. One, we don't have runoff. Phosphorus doesn't off gas like nitrate does. Phosphorus with no runoff and organic forms that are slow to cycle, it's not going anywhere.  If we added seven cups of fish bone meal and five cups of calphos, the phosphate's going to be well over 2300 for the next round. But then you are not going to have to add any phosphate for like three rounds maybe.  **Seven cups of fish bone will bring in 96 pounds of nitrate.????**\n- ( I am confused by the 96 pounds of Nitrate)..but...Brandon starts out figuring how much Nitrate needed to be added by starting at 200 as the target,  He then subtracts the amount of Nitrate in the fish bone meal (which he calculated to be 96 lbs, and I don't understand how that happens) 200lbs/acre Nitrate target - 96 lbs/acre -2 lbs/acre left in the soil = 102 lbs/acre deficit that can be filled with different nitrate inputs.\n- Brandon's three favorite Nitrogen additives include alfalfa, soybean, and feather meal.  Any input that you get is going to have its fines (In soil science, \"fines\" refer to the fine particles in soil, like silt and clay) . So there's a fast little flush of nitrate from feather meal because of the fines, but then it slowly breaks down, trickles out through the rest of the round. And so something like blood meal, it's going to be super fast, very available. You're going to burn through all of it in the first month. Brandon likes to do multiple inputs for different release rates when a larger amount of Nitrogen is needed.", "id": "32448e88-1056-44c5-ad00-b657088b05fe"}

Brandon's target for soluble salts is around 1,000 to 1,200. Something that Brandon has noticed from looking at thousands of reports is that this number really is just reflective of your calcium, magnesium, potassium, and chlorides. It should be more, it should give us a better picture of nitrate as well.  But Brandon used to think nitrates were  also reflected in the Soluble Salts number.  This doesn't seem to be the case, because he'll see really low numbers with really high nitrates and ammonium. And so when Brandon looks at the Soluble Salts number,  he uses it mainly as a guesstimate as to how he is going to balance the cations. The number on the Saturated Paste test (425 lbs/acre ) tells us without even looking at your calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium that they're gonna be low. And sure enough, they are.  Once the Soluble Salt number gets above 1,200,  the plant could grow well, but we're going past sufficiency. When the Soluble Salt level exceeds the sufficiency number of around 1,200, plants experience increased osmotic stress\n- Chloride at 52 ppm is great!  200-300 is in the very high range.  The sodium and chloride metrics are very low.  Four or five rounds of growing should be possible without thinking about flushing.\n- Everybody's trace elements are low. I don't worry about it because if the chlorides aren't high, it doesn't block and you don't have issues. As long as you're not over watering or having chlorides, trace elements are rarely gonna be the limiting factor.  Brandon does not like to increase the trace elements because low amounts do not block the health of the plant and too much trace elements (e.g.: Boron) could mean throwing out the soil.\n- Bicarbonates at 34 ppm.  That's fantastic.  Brandon  noted maybe one in a thousand tests, he'll see a bicarbonate issue. If the Bicarbonates number is anything under 120, I wouldn't even worry about. If the number is too high, it's going to be reflecting in the pH and other readings will be off because of the hard water.\n- Sulfur at 37.82 ppm  is low.  I like to target a reading of 68.  Adding elemental Sulfur to adjust the Sulfur level is a mistake in this situation since the pH is 5.5. Elemental Sulfur is great at lowering the pH.  Which is exactly what we do not need.  Since the Soluble Salts number is low, the Cations (CA, MG, K) when these are fixed will bring in the Sulfates that will raise the amount of Sulfur.\n- The Phosphorus number is at 0.77 ppm.  Although higher than many, 0.77  is below the target of 2.4 (which 97% of the growers are below this target). That tells me that at the minimum sufficiency of 1500 lbs/acre of Phosphate, you're getting 0.77 available. So there's two things we could do. We can bump up the  reserve, which we're gonna do.  And/or we could add microbial mass, like the Mammoth P product  once a week. Brandon has some growers that have phosphorus (as Phosphate) reserves above 3000. They're running microbial mass or something like that once a month. They are getting readings far greater than 2.4 ppm - around 6 ppm because their reserve is so high.\n- The cations: let's do calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium.", "id": "9021323a-897b-4a47-90bd-50ae24b605ee"}

That goes back to magnesium in practice and actual field practice. Magnesium runs the cations. It will out-compete potassium.

But the normal way to correct high Magnesium, let's say your magnesium's 52 and your calcium's 104, you simply divide 52 by the target, 38, and that gives me a factor of 1.37.

You could add 1.1 cups of magnesium sulfate, or you could do nothing and wait and see if you get a magnesium deficiency.  A lot of times Tad, when he's doing recommendations, he'll skip over magnesium as long as it's in deficit and just tell them not to do anything unless they see a problem. And that's a safe way to handle it. What Brandon typically does is bump down the amount to amend to 1/2 of the deficit. In this case 0.75 cups of magnesium sulfate.  Most growers go in with a heavy hand. Even if they fall short, it's so easy to fix that with the magnesium drench. The plants will respond in 24 to 48 hours.  I want to make sure that you've got enough to get going.  Magnesium is the central element in the chlorophyll molecule. So it is very important to be in the soil.\n\nGetting a cup or less of magnesium sulfate spread out evenly over a bed is going to be really hard. You're going to have dead spots and hot spots.

I prefer the target range of 6.8 to 6.9 for optimal nutrient release rates and reduced\u00a0heavy metal uptake.\u00a0 Continue to pH your irrigation events to 6.8-7.0 with a heavy metals safe pH down product. I prefer citric acid. You're\u00a0too close to perfect to make any adjustments here. Great job! You will have an excellent round at 7.0.\n- Organic matter percentage is not an accurate metric for\u00a0potting soils, ignore.\u00a0\n- 2160 lbs/acra of P2O5\u00a0is a touch above my target of 1500, but excellent. Phosphorus is hard to get into solution so a really big reserve is required to provide available P to your plants. It is really hard to have too much P. No action, this is great!\u00a0\n- Cations look a touch off but we will look at the Paste Report for actionable metrics. I place much more weight on the available cations shown on your Paste Report.\u00a0\n-\t- The Cations on the mehlic-3 test:\n\t\t- Calcium (60-70%) : 81.28\n\t\t- Magnesium (10-20%): 9.48\n\t\t- Potassium (2-5%): 3.57\n\t\t- Sodium (.5 to 3%): 1.26\n- Sodium is good but creeping up at\u00a090 lbs/acre. I ask folks to flush anytime they hit 200 so you should be able to get several more rounds without a flush. Luckily sodium is easy to flush. If sodium gets too high it causes osmotic stress and can outcompete productive cations, especially potassium. Once you approach 200 ppm we will want to set up a plan to flush. Flush 10% by volume. Be sure to get the soil to field capacity and use a surfactant to improve the efficacy of the flush. You will want to capture 10% by volume meaning if you have a 4'x4' with 100 gallons you will need to capture 10 gallons. Be sure to add some trichoderma (Rootshield) or some Lactobacillus at the end of your flush to prevent fungal pathogens from taking a foothold. If you choose to run this without a flush be on the lookout for cation deficiencies and symptoms of osmotic stress. No action at this time.\n- Exchangeable\u00a0hydrogen is just another way\u00a0to look at PH, you can ignore.\n- Your trace elements look a bit off (Cu 1.17 ppm and Zn 3.33 ppm) but be careful chasing a \"perfect\" trace element metric. There is almost always plenty of trace available through contamination from water or compost. Trace elements, while essential, are not composed into the plant and can be used over and over again so very little is needed. The margin for error between a perfect metric and dead plants and ruined soil is hard to achieve in a field\u00a0with an enormous buffer so it is dangerous territory in raised beds or pots. Proceed with caution. It is my opinion that these should be left alone unless a specific deficiency tied to one of the trace elements shows visually.\u00a0\n- Ammonium at 0.2 ppm is great. I normally\u00a0look for a metric of 0.9 or lower. This soil is temperature stable. You should not get any additional nitrate release from this either. No action.\n-  anytime Nitrate drops below 30 ppm all growth stops but I get equally concerned anytime a test goes over 200 for an indoor run.\u00a0 Do not over apply. Excess nitrate at harvest diminishes terpenes, reduces yield and delays senescence.\u00a0 It is always a best practice to add as many nitrate inputs as possible for optimal release rates. You will have a small gap to fill.\n-\n- **2.4 * 0.274 = .66 of a cup** cups of neem\n- **3 * 0.274 = .822** cups of crab and\u00a0\n- **3 * 0.274 = .822** cups of blood meal per yard", "id": "dff39905-ba30-48e2-88b4-4fc461b8dddd"}

Optimally, this should be between 1,000 - 1,200.  Note: research additional info as well as say why this number is important.\n- Chloride = 223 ppm.  This sounds high? Research.\n- Bicarbonates = 45 ppm. Research, report, say why.\n- Sulfur(s) = 295 ppm.  You will need to research the documents to determine what is the target value for Sulfur.,  Also include why sulfur is important.\n- Phosphorous = 0.41 ppm.  Same as with Sulfur - research what level it should be and say why it is important.\n- Percent Cation\n\t- Calcium: 78\n\t- Magnesium: 9.83\n\t- Potassium: 10.01\n\t- Sodium: 2.17\nThe ratio between the cations is super important. Research why, what it should be, and then compare/contrast what we have here.  For example, I think Calcium is too high.\n- TBD: Unclear about what the trace elements tell us.

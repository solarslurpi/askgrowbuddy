Hey, listener. Ready to dive into some serious Kirkland future planning with us today?
We're talking about the Kirkland 2044 Comprehensive Plan Update.
That's right. This plan is basically the city's roadmap for the next 20 years.
Exactly. We're talking housing, transportation, jobs, the whole shebang.
And the best part, you, our listener, have a voice in how this all unfolds.
It's true. This isn't just some bureaucratic document. It's about shaping the future of the place we call home.
OK, so let's unpack this Kirkland 2044 plan. It sounds like L.A.T. is changing.
Where do we even begin? What was the catalyst for this huge undertaking?
Well, every eight years, Washington state requires cities and counties to give these comprehensive plans a refresh.
Makes sense. Kind of like a check in to make sure everyone's still on the same page.
Exactly. This new 2044 plan will be replacing the current plan, Kirkland 2035.
And one of the biggest things this update grapples with is how to handle some serious population growth.
Oh, yeah, I bet. Kirkland has gotten super popular lately. So how many new people are we talking about here? Give us the numbers.
Hold on to your hats. The plan projects a need for an additional 13,200 housing units and a whopping 26,490 new jobs by 2044.
Whoa, that's a lot of new neighbors. And that's on top of what, nearly 3,130 housing units and over 1,500 jobs added since 2019, right?
So where is everyone going to live?
Well, that's the million dollar question. And what the plan tries to address through something they call frequent transit corridors.
Frequent transit corridors. OK, now you're just using fancy planning lingo on me. Break it down for us. What does that even mean?
Essentially, the plan is aiming to concentrate more housing and jobs along these key transportation routes.
Think Central Way, 100th Avenue, N.E., even parts of N.E. 85th Street.
Interesting. So less suburban sprawl, more like urban style living.
Exactly. The idea is that by concentrating growth in areas well served by public transit, we can reduce reliance on cars and create a more sustainable, less car dependent city.
Makes sense in theory. But some of those quarters are still just two lane roads right now. I can already picture them being jammed with even more cars.
What could go wrong, right?
That's a major point of debate right now. This whole push for density has definitely stirred up strong feelings on both sides.
Ah, the classic growth conundrum. And speaking of dilemmas, we have to talk about Adam Weinstein, Kirkland's director of city planning.
His letter to the city paints one picture, but then there's this YouTube video where he seems to be singing a different tune.
Yeah, his messaging has been a bit mixed, which understandably has some folks scratching their heads.
Exactly. In his letter, he seems really focused on the need for more affordable housing.
Even going so far as to suggest that taxing inefficient constructions, which many see as code for single family homes, could help fund affordable housing development.
Right. And it's no secret that this idea has sparked quite the controversy, especially among those who feel like they're being unfairly targeted.
It's almost like he's pointing a finger at baby boomers, saying they're the root of the problem.
But then in this YouTube video, he's all about HB 1110, this new state law designed to encourage more of what's called middle housing.
He's suggesting this could be the answer to affordability issues.
And what's interesting there is that he's essentially highlighting two very different approaches to the same problem.
The critical need for more housing, especially housing that people can actually afford.
It's true. The question is, which path is more effective? Or is there some kind of hybrid approach that could work for Kirkland?
It's a complex issue with no easy answers. And that's why it's so important for residents to be engaged in this process and make their voices heard.
Absolutely. And speaking of different approaches, Councilmember John Pascal has been pretty vocal about his thoughts on the plan.
He seems to be advocating for what he calls a more measured approach.
He has. He agrees that we desperately need more affordable housing, but urges the city to focus on making existing projects successful before spreading resources too thin.
He points to the ongoing development at Totem Lake as a prime example.
Yeah, that's an interesting point. It's like trying to juggle too many balls at once, right? Something's bound to drop.
Exactly. Pascal argues that concentrating on those areas already designated for urban growth allows the city to create more housing with the infrastructure to support it, whether that's transit, schools or utilities.
Makes sense. Trying to transform every single neighborhood into a high-density urban center overnight just isn't realistic.
But this whole thing, with the different viewpoints, conflicting messages, it does raise some red flags about transparency, doesn't it?
It does. And we've heard those concerns from several residents, with some even drawing comparisons to Robert Moses and his controversial urban renewal projects.
Yokes. That's a pretty loaded comparison. But I get where they're coming from. When big changes are happening, and it's not always clear who those changes benefit most, people start to get nervous.
Exactly. And that's why transparency from the city is crucial. Residents need to feel confident that they're being heard, that their concerns are being taken seriously, and that this plan is truly being crafted with the best interests of the entire community in mind.
Well said. And that's something we'll definitely be keeping a close eye on as this plan moves forward. We want to hear from you, our listener. What are your thoughts on the Kirkland 2044 plan? What are your hopes and concerns?
We'll be diving into the city's community engagement process in our next segment, so stay tuned.
So how does the city plan to address these concerns about transparency and make sure residents feel heard during this whole 2044 planning process? They have that whole community engagement plan, right?
They do. And it's pretty impressive. They've outlined a really comprehensive strategy for gathering input, addressing concerns, and keeping residents informed.
Oh, yeah. I took a look at it. It's not every day you see a city dedicating so much time and energy to just getting people involved. It's not just a couple of public hearings and call it a day, is it?
No, not even close. It seems like they're really going above and beyond the usual, trying to meet people where they are, so to speak.
So what, are they setting up shop at the farmer's market now or something?
Well, not quite, but they have mentioned things like pop-up events at bus stops and grocery stores to try to catch people going about their daily lives.
That's kind of cool, but it's not all about quirky locations, right?
Right. They're also planning more traditional, community-wide discussions, focused conversations with specific groups, presentations at neighborhood association meetings.
They're really casting a wide net to get those diverse voices heard.
It's great that they're trying to reach people who might not typically show up at a planning meeting in City Hall.
Exactly. And they're using everything in their toolkit to spread the word about all these engagement opportunities, social media, traditional media, even developing curriculum for local high schools to get students thinking about the future of their city.
That's forward thinking. Getting the younger generation involved, they're the ones who are going to be living with the consequences of these decisions.
Exactly. It's their future we're talking about. And what's really important is the city has stressed that this isn't just about gathering feedback in a vacuum.
They also want to circle back and let people know how their input is being used, how it's shaping the plan.
So it's a two-way street, a real dialogue, not just a one-way lecture from the city. That's reassuring.
Absolutely. And they're even taking it a step further with something they call a risk register in their community engagement plan.
A risk register. Okay, now that sounds a tad ominous.
Are they expecting this whole thing to go off the rails?
Not necessarily. But it shows they're thinking ahead, acknowledging that any project of this scale will inevitably have its challenges.
So being proactive, trying to anticipate potential problems before they become major roadblocks.
Exactly. They've actually identified potential risks to the success of their community engagement efforts.
And they've brainstormed strategies to mitigate those risks and even developed backup plans.
Wow, they've really thought this through.
It definitely shows a level of commitment to transparency and inclusivity that is honestly pretty refreshing.
But okay, let's get down to brass tacks here.
What are some of the tangible changes residents might actually see in their neighborhoods because of this 2044 plan?
Well, one of the biggest will likely be that increase in density, especially along those frequent transit corridors we were talking about earlier.
So more apartment buildings, townhomes, that kind of thing popping up along those main roads.
Exactly. And they're encouraging a mix of different housing types, including something they call missing middle housing.
Missing middle. Now that sounds intriguing. I'm picturing like a duplex wearing a monocle.
What is that exactly?
Okay, maybe not a monocle, but you're on the right track. It's basically a catch-all term for those housing types that fall somewhere between a single-family home and a giant apartment complex.
Okay, so think duplexes, triplexes, townhomes, maybe those courtyard apartment buildings.
Exactly. And those types of housing can often fit more seamlessly into existing neighborhoods without requiring a drastic change in character.
So it's not just about cramming as many people as possible into a given space, but about fostering a more diverse and hopefully more affordable housing market.
Precisely. And the plan really emphasizes the importance of good design, too.
It talks about making sure any new development is aesthetically pleasing, fits in with the surrounding neighborhood, and enhances the overall character of the city.
Okay, so no more eyesore developments plopped down in the middle of charming, established neighborhoods.
Hopefully not. The plan is all about encouraging high-quality design that respects Kirkland's unique character, but also allows for new development to have its own sense of place.
And, of course, you can't talk about Kirkland without talking about its green spaces.
Exactly. What about parks, trails, all those beautiful outdoor spaces? Are those going to survive all this growth and development?
That's a great question, and thankfully it's something the plan addresses head-on.
They've actually integrated the goals and policies from the 2022 Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Plan, the PROS plan, right into this 2044 plan.
So it's not just about building more housing. It's about creating a livable city where residents can still connect with nature and enjoy those beautiful outdoor spaces we all love.
Exactly. And it's about improving what we already have, too.
They're looking at ways to make existing parks even better, adding more trails, and making sure those green spaces are accessible to everyone in Kirkland, no matter where they live.
That's music to my ears.
Yeah.
But it's not just about creating a few big parks, is it? It's about weaving nature into the fabric of the city itself, right?
You got it.
They even talk about wanting to integrate parks and open spaces into new developments.
Imagine being able to walk or bike from your home to a park or trail without having to even hop in your car.
Now that's the dream. And it sounds like they're serious about protecting and enhancing Kirkland's existing natural environment, too.
I mean, those wetlands, streams, forests. That's what makes this place special.
You said it. And they've set some ambitious goals for things like reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving water quality, protecting biodiversity, which all tie back into the bigger picture of sustainability.
It's heartening to hear that they're really taking that long-term view, recognizing that a healthy environment is the foundation for a thriving community.
But we also have to think about the human side of all this growth, right?
How will the 2044 plan impact housing affordability, access to crucial services, that kind of thing?
That's where the housing element of the plan comes in.
It really gets into the nitty-gritty of affordability, diversity of housing options, and making sure there's something for everyone in Kirkland, not just those who can afford to pay top dollar.
So bring it down for us. What are some of the key things they're looking at in this housing element?
Well, one of the big ones is increasing the overall supply of housing, especially housing that's affordable for a wider range of incomes.
It's not just about building more units. It's about building the right kind of units.
So that means looking at ways to encourage a greater variety of housing options, from single-family homes to townhomes, apartments, maybe even those accessory dwelling units, ADUs, that are becoming more and more popular.
So it's about having options, right? Making sure there's something for everyone in Kirkland, whether you're a young professional just starting out, a growing family, or someone looking to downsize in retirement.
Exactly. And they're being mindful of providing adequate housing for seniors, people with disabilities, other groups that might need specific types of housing.
It's about creating a more inclusive community where everyone has access to safe and affordable options.
That's what we like to hear. But it's one thing to build it. It's another thing to make sure people can actually afford to live there, right?
Especially with all the concerns we've heard about displacement and longtime residents being priced out.
You're absolutely right, and that's a huge issue that the plan acknowledges.
They're exploring things like inclusionary zoning, which basically requires developers to include a certain percentage of affordable units in new projects.
So not just building more luxury condos.
Right. And they're also looking into community land trusts, which is a really interesting model that can help keep housing affordable over the long term, even as the market changes.
Okay. So some promising ideas on the table. But it's not just about putting a roof over people's heads, is it? It's about having access to transportation, jobs, all the things that make for a good quality of life.
Absolutely. And the plan touches on all of that. They talk about making sure public transit keeps pace with growth, improving connections to job centers, and supporting those essential human services that folks rely on.
Okay. So they're thinking about the whole picture.
They are. They want to make sure that as Kirkland grows, it remains a place where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, not just survive. And that means having those support systems in place so that people can truly flourish.
Well said. We've covered a lot of ground here today. We've talked about housing, transportation, sustainability, community engagement. It's a lot for our listeners to digest. It is a lot. But hey, that's what we're here for, right? To break it all down and make sure our listeners have the information they need to be informed and engaged citizens.
Exactly. Because at the end of the day, this plan, as comprehensive as it is, is really just a starting point.
Right. That's an interesting way to think about it. So it's not like they're handing us this big finished product and saying, here's your future, deal with it.
Not at all. It's more like they've laid out the foundation, the broad strokes, and now it's up to all of us as a community to work together to fill in the details.
I like that. It's a collaborative effort. But that only works if people actually feel like they have a seat at the table, right?
Yeah.
We talked earlier about those concerns about transparency and maybe even some skepticism about whether those in charge are really listening.
And those concerns are valid. We've seen these kinds of planning processes go sideways before, where it feels like decisions are being made behind closed doors and residents' voices are being ignored.
Exactly. So how do we avoid that here? How do we make sure this Kirkland 2044 plan truly reflects the needs and values of the entire community, not just a select few?
Well, I think it starts with residents holding the city accountable. Don't be afraid to ask those tough questions. Challenge assumptions. Show up at those meetings. Submit your comments online. Make your voice heard.
So you're saying our listener has every right to raise their hand, speak their mind, and hold the city's feet to the fire, so to speak.
Absolutely. This is their city, their future. They have every right to demand transparency and accountability from those in charge.
I love that. It's empowering, right? Yeah. Knowing that you have a voice in shaping the future of the place you call home.
It is. And it's not just about speaking up. It's about staying informed. This is a long process with multiple phases and opportunities for public input. So make sure you're checking in regularly, reading those updates from the city, and attending those meetings.
Yeah. Don't just assume that because you went to one open house, you're good to go, right?
Exactly. This is a marathon, not a sprint.
Well said. And this is where I think the role of our elected officials is so crucial, because at the end of the day, they're the ones who are going to be voting on whether or not to adopt this plan.
Exactly. They have a huge responsibility to represent the best interests of their constituents, and that means taking those constituent concerns seriously.
Absolutely. So it's not enough for our listeners to just show up at a public meeting or two, right?
They need to be engaging directly with their elected officials, letting them know what they think, what their priorities are.
Absolutely. Send those emails, make those phone calls, remind those elected officials who they work for, the people.
This is our chance as a community to work together to shape the future of Kirkland.
Well said. We've covered a lot of ground today, but I think our listener has a much better understanding of what this Kirkland 2044 plan is all about.
It's ambitious, it's complex, but ultimately it's about creating a shared vision for the future.
And that shared vision, that's what's so exciting. It's about deciding what kind of community we want to be, what kind of legacy we want to leave for future generations.
It's about more than just buildings and roads and zoning codes, isn't it? It's about our values.
Exactly. It's about sustainability, affordability, equity, opportunity.
It's about creating a Kirkland where everyone feels welcome, supported, and empowered to thrive.
That's beautifully said. And that's a future worth fighting for.
That's a wrap for this deep dive into the Kirkland 2044 Comprehensive Plan Update.
We hope you found it informative and empowering.
And remember, the future of Kirkland is in your hands.
Stay informed, get involved, and make your voice heard.
We'll see you next time for another fascinating exploration.
